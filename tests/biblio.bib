  abstract      = {We show on gauge invariance grounds that the fine threshold phenomenon is discovered in the radiative decays $\phi\to\gamma a_0 \to \gamma \pi_0 \eta$ and $\phi \to \gamma f_0 \to \gamma \pi_0\pi_0$. This enables to conclude that production of the lightest scalar mesons $a_0(980)$ and $f_0(980)$ in these decays is caused by the four-quark transitions, resulting in strong restrictions on the large $N_C$ expansions of the decay amplitudes. The analysis shows that these constraints give new evidences in favor of the four-quark nature of $a_0(980)$ and $f_0(980)$ mesons.},

  Abstract                 = {We hypothesize that a particle's charge varies weakly with its velocity. Specifically, suppose that the charge of a slow electron (or proton) varies as q=e(1+kv2c2), where |k|<<1. This hypothesis can be tested for conduction electrons by rotating a current-carrying solenoid inside a Faraday ice pail. Alternatively, a block of metal may be cooled inside an ice pail. Using either of these two techniques we find |k|<10-5. For free electrons, we use electron beam measurements of others to determine that |k|<0.2. Finally a limit of |k|<2*10-15 is inferred for bound electrons from existing data on the neutrality of various atoms.},

  Abstract                 = {Tau lepton decays with open strangeness in the final state are measured with the OPAL detector at LEP to determine the strange hadronic spectral function of the tau lepton. The decays $T \to (K, \pi)^-\nu \tau$, $(K\pi\pi)^-\nu \tau$ and $(K\pi\pi\pi)^-\nu \tau$ with final states consisting of neutral and charged kaons and pions have been studied. The invariant mass distributions of $93.4\%$ of these final states have been experimentally determined. Monte Carlo simulations have been used for the remaining $6.6\%$ and for the strange final states including $\eta$ mesons. The reconstructed strange final states, corrected for resolution effects and detection efficiencies, yield the strange spectral function of the $\tau$ lepton. The moments of the spectral function and the ration of strange to non-strange moments, which are important input parameters for theoretical analysis, are determined. Furthermore, the branching fractions $B(\tau^- \to K^-\pi^0\nu \tau)=(0.471\pm0.064\text{stat}\pm0.022\text{sys})\%$ and $B(\tau^- \to K^-\pi^+\pi^-\nu \tau)=(0.415\pm0.059\text{stat}\pm0.031\text{sys})\%$ have been measured.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a measurement of the inclusive jet cross section in $p-\bar p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=1.96~\TeV$ based on data collected by the CDF II detector with an integrated luminosity of $1.13~\fb^{-1}$. The measurement was made using the cone-based Midpoint jet clustering algorithm in the rapidity region of $|y|<2.1$. The results are consistent with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD predictions based on recent parton distribution functions (PDFs), and are expected to provide increased precision in PDFs at high parton momentum fraction $x$. The results are also compared to the recent inclusive jet cross section measurement using the $k_T$ jet clustering algorithm, and we find that the ratio of the cross sections measured with the two algorithms is in agreement with theoretical expectations over a large range of jet transverse momentum and rapidity.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the first observation and cross section measurement of exclusive dijet production in pbar-p interactions, $\bar p + p \to \bar p + \text{dijet} + p$. Using a data sample of $310~\pb^{-1}$ collected by the Run II Collider Detector at Fermilab at $\sqrt{s}=1.96~\TeV$, exclusive cross sections for events with two jets of transverse energy $E_T \geq 10~\GeV$ have been measured as a function of minimum $E_T(\text{jet})$. The exclusive signal is extracted from fits to data distributions based on Monte Carlo simulations of expected dijet signal and background shapes. The simulated background distribution shapes are checked in a study of a largely independent data sample of $200~\pb^{-1}$ of $b$-tagged jet events, where exclusive dijet production is expected to be suppressed by the $J_z=0$ total angular momentum selection rule. Results obtained are compared with theoretical expectations, and implications for exclusive Higgs boson production at the pp Large Hadron Collider at $\sqrt{s}=14~\TeV$ are discussed.},

No evidence is found for charged Higgs production, and most parts of the [$M_{H^+}$, $\tan\beta$] parameter space where the decay $t \to H + b$ has a branching fraction close to or larger than that for $t \to W + b$ are excluded at 95\% confidence level. Assuming $m_t = 175GeV$ and $\sigma(p\bar p \to t \bar t) = 5.5pb$, for $M_{H^+} = 60GeV$, we exclude $\tan\beta<0.97$ and $\tan\beta>40.9$.},

The results agree in shape with the next-to-leading order QCD calculation of heavy flavor production but are greater than the central values of these predictions.

  abstract      = {We study the decays of the J/psi and psi' mesons to pi+pi-pi0 using data samples at both resonances collected with the BES III detector in 2009. We measure the corresponding branching fractions with unprecedented precision and provide mass spectra and Dalitz plots. The branching fraction for J/psi -> pi+pi-pi0 is determined to be (2.137 +- 0.004 (stat.) +0.058-0.056 (syst.) +0.027-0.026 (norm.))*10-2, and the branching fraction for psi' -> pi+pi-pi0 is measured as (2.14 +- 0.03 (stat.) +0.08-0.07 (syst.) +0.09-0.08 (norm.))*10-4. The J/psi decay is found to be dominated by an intermediate rho(770) state, whereas the psi' decay is dominated by di-pion masses around 2.2 GeV/c2, leading to strikingly different Dalitz distributions.},

  Abstract                 = {The branching ratio of the rare decay $\pi^0 \to e^+ e^-$ has been measured precisely, using the complete data set from the KTeV E799-II experiment at Fermilab. We observe 794 candidate $\pi^0 \to e^+ e^-$ events using $K^0_L \to 3\pi^0$ as a source of tagged $\pi^0$'s. The expected background is $52.7 \pm 11.2$ events, predominantly from high $e^+ e^-$ mass $\pi^0 \to e^+ e^- \gamma$ decays. We have measured $B[(\pi^0 \to e^+ e^-), (m_{e^+e^-}/m_{\pi^0})^2 > 0.95] = 6.44 \pm 0.25(\text{stat}) \pm 0.22(\text{syst}) \times 10^{-8}$, which is above the unitary bound from $\pi^0 \to \gamma \gamma$ and within the range of theoretical expectations from the standard model.},

We use a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $193~\pb^{-1}$ collected by the upgraded Collider Detector at Fermilab. No evidence for charged Higgs production is found, allowing $95\% C.L.$ upper limits to be placed on $BR(t \to H+b)$ for different charged Higgs decay scenarios.

We require the absence of any particle signatures in the detector except for an electron and a positron candidate, each with transverse energy $E_T>5~\GeV$ and pseudorapidity $|\eta|<2$. With these criteria, 16 events are observed compared to a background expectation of $1.9\pm0.3$ events. These events are consistent in cross section and properties with the QED process $p\bar{p} \to p + e^+e^- + \bar{p}$ through two-photon exchange. The measured cross section is $1.6^{+0.5}_{-0.3}\mathrm{(stat)}\pm0.3\mathrm{(syst)}~\pb$. This agrees with the theoretical prediction of $1.71 \pm 0.01~\pb$.},

It is pointed out that a naive inclusion of the large decay widths in the scalar meson propagators is not an adequate approximation for physical amplitudes. It is shown that the simplest unitarization scheme for the real $\pi\pi \to \pi\pi$ Born amplitude with $l=I=0$ leads to a broad resonance arising with a mass $m_{res}\approx 420~\MeV$ and a width $\Gamma_{res}(m_{res}^2)\approx 740~\MeV$ at the bare $\sigma$ meson mass $m_\sigma \approx 1~\GeV$. The resonance parameters are largely controlled by the nonresonant background amplitude. Some applications to other reactions are also discussed.},

Within the framework of the Operator Product Expansion a simultaneous determination of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$, the non-perturbative operators of dimension 6 and 8 and of the gluon condensate has been performed. Different perturbative descriptions have been compared to the data. The Contour Improved Fixed Order Perturbation Theory gives $\alpha_s(m_\tau^2) = 0.348 \pm 0.009 \pm 0.019$ at the $\tau$-mass scale and $\alpha_s(m_z^2) = 0.1219 \pm 0.0010 \pm 0.0017$ at the $Z$-mass scale. The values obtained for $\alpha_s(m_z^2)$ using Fixed Order Perturbation Theory or Renormalon Chain Resummation are 2.3\% and 4.1\% smaller, respectively. The running of the strong coupling between $s_0 \sim 1.3~\GeV^2$ and $s_0 = m_\tau^2$ has been tested from direct fits to the integrated differential hadronic decay rate $R_\tau$. A test of the saturation of QCD sum rules at the tau-mass scale has been performed.},

The background from non-prompt sources is determined using a statistical method based on differences in the electromagnetic showers. The cross section is measured as a function of the diphoton mass, the transverse momentum of the diphoton system, and the azimuthal angle between the two photons and is found to be consistent with perturbative QCD predictions.},

The experimental data in the space-like region are well reproduced with a minimal number of parameters. The results are similar to those obtained from a dipole fit up to $1~\GeV^2$, but they surprisingly show a zero between $2$ and $3~\GeV^2$. Such behavior, predicted by the present model completely disagrees with the dipole parametrization. The theoretical expression for the form factor is then analytically extrapolated to the time-like region, giving the first predictions in this regime. This kinematical region is especially interesting for present and future colliders.},

This lifetime corresponds to $|a_0-a_2|=0.264 ^{+0.033}_{-0.020} m_{\pi}^{-1}$.},

We give in explicit form the function describing the one-loop correction to the distribution in phase space of the final state photons.},

It is demonstrated that excitation of inelastic hadronic intermediate states by the consecutive exchange of two photons leads to logarithmic and double-logarithmic enhancement due to contributions of hard collinear quasi-real photons. The asymmetry at small electron scattering angles is expressed in terms of the total photoproduction cross section on the proton, and is predicted to reach the magnitude of 20-30 parts per million. At these conditions and fixed 4-momentum transfers, the asymmetry is rising logarithmically with increasing electron beam energy, following the high-energy diffractive behavior of total photoproduction cross section on the proton.},

The construction relies crucially on the definition of two dimensionful quantities, which are invariant under the renormalization group, and are built out of very particular combinations of the aforementioned Green's functions. The main non-perturbative feature of both effective charges, encoded in the infrared finiteness of the gluon propagator and ghost dressing function used in their definition, is the freezing at a common finite (non-vanishing) value, in agreement with a plethora of theoretical and phenomenological expectations. We discuss the sizable discrepancy between the freezing values obtained from the present lattice analysis and the corresponding estimates derived from several phenomenological studies, and attribute its origin to the difference in the gauges employed. A particular toy calculation suggests that the modifications induced to the non-perturbative gluon propagator by the gauge choice may indeed account for the observed deviation of the freezing values.},

Despite their distinct theoretical origin, due to a fundamental identity relating various of the ingredients appearing in their respective definitions, the two effective charges are almost identical in the entire range of physical momenta, and coincide exactly in the deep infrared, where they freeze at a common finite value. Specifically, the dressing function of the ghost propagator is related to the two form factors in the Lorentz decomposition of a certain Green's function, appearing in a variety of field-theoretic contexts. The central identity, which is valid only in the Landau gauge, is derived from the Schwinger-Dyson equations governing the dynamics of the aforementioned quantities. The renormalization procedure that preserves the validity of the identity is carried out, and various relevant kinematic limits and physically motivated approximations are studied in detail. A crucial ingredient in this analysis is the infrared finiteness of the gluon propagator, which is inextricably connected with the aforementioned freezing of the effective charges. Some important issues related to the consistent definition of the effective charge in the presence of such a gluon propagator are resolved. We finally present a detailed numerical study of a special set of Schwinger-Dyson equations, whose solutions determine the non-perturbative dynamics of the quantities composing the two effective charges.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce diquarks as separable correlations in the two-quark Green's function to facilitate the description of baryons as relativistic three-quark bound states. These states then emerge as solutions of Bethe-Salpeter equations for quarks and diquarks that interact via quark exchange. When solving these equations we consider various dressing functions for the free quark and diquark propagators that prohibit the existence of corresponding asymptotic states and thus effectively parameterize confinement. We study the implications of qualitatively different dressing functions on the model predictions for the masses of the octet baryons as well as the electromagnetic and strong form factors of the nucleon. For different dressing functions we in particular compare the predictions for kaon photoproduction, $\gamma p\to K\Lambda$, and associated strangeness production, $pp\to pK\Lambda$ with experimental data. This leads to conclusions on the permissibility of different dressing functions.},

The cases of a muonic pair and pion systems $\pi^{+}\pi^{-},\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{0}$ are considered in detail for electron-proton or photon-proton collisions in the proton fragmentation region kinematics. COC arise from interference of amplitudes which describe the different mechanisms of charged leptons (pions) creation. One of them corresponds to production of particles in the charge-odd state (one virtual photon or vector meson annihilation to this system of particles) and the other corresponds to the charge-even state of produced particles (creation by two photons). COC for muon-antimuon pair creation have a pure QED nature and can be considered as a normalization process. The processes with pion production are sensitive to some characteristics of proton wave functions and, besides, can be used for checking the anomalous and normal parts of the effective pionic lagrangian. Three electromagnetic currents operator matrix element can be measured in photon-proton interactions with lepton pair production. For this aim a charge-odd combination of cross sections can be constructed as a conversion of leptonic 3-rank tensor with hadronic ones. These experiments can be considered as an alternative to deep virtual Compton scattering.},

  Abstract                 = {Process of two pion production in electron - polarized proton scattering is investigated. In Weizs\"acker-Williams approximation the differential spectral distributions and the spin-momentum correlations are considered. The spin correlation effects caused by $\rho$-meson widths are estimated to be of order of several percents. Both channels of $\pi^+\pi^-$ and $\pi^+\pi^0$ creation are considered. The effects of intermediate excited baryons are not considered. The spectral distributions on pion energy fractions in polarized and unpolarized cases are presented analytically and numerically.},

The LFV decay rates are proportional to products of two triplet Yukawa couplings ($h_{ij}$) which can be expressed in terms of the parameters of the neutrino mass matrix and an unknown triplet vacuum expectation value. We determine the parameter space of the neutrino mass matrix in which a signal for $\tau \to \bar{l}ll$ and/or $\mu \to e \gamma$ is possible at ongoing and planned experiments. The conditions for respecting the stringent upper limit for $\mu \to eee$ are studied in detail, with emphasis given to the possibility of $\brm{h_{ee}}\simeq 0$ which can only be realized if Majorana phases are present.},

The results for charged pions and charged and neutral kaons correspond to all data available, which were collected from 2002 to 2004. For all final state particles both the Collins and Sivers asymmetries turn out to be small, compatible with zero within the statistical errors, in line with the previously published results for not identified charged hadrons, and with the expected cancellation between the $u$- and $d$-quark contributions.},

Our first approach, more classical, relies on calculations "by hand" with reasonable approximations. Our second approach relies on program packages FeynArts, FormCalc, LoopTools, and FORM. The detailed numerical analysis of the various contributions is provided for a wide range of energies relevant for the ultra-precise 11 GeV MOLLER experiment planned at the Jefferson Laboratory, as well as future experiments at the International Linear Collider (ILC). The numerical results obtained within the on-shell renormalization scheme using two different sets of renormalization conditions are in excellent agreement. We also calculate the total NLO correction in the Constrained Differential Renormalization (CDR) scheme. Analysis of the results, along with the increasing experimental precision, shows that it is feasible that the corrections at the Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (NNLO) level may be important for the next generation of high-precision experiments.},

The QCD corrections are calculated in the leading and next-to-leading logarithmic approximations, but the QED corrections are considered in the leading logarithmic approximation only. These corrections are numerically important for precisely testing the universality of the charged current weak interactions in $t$-quark decays. As the $\tau^+$ leptons arising from the decays $W^+ \to \tau^+ \nu_\tau$ and $H^+\to \tau^+ \nu_\tau$ are predominantly left- and right-polarised, respectively, influencing the energy distributions of the decay products in the subsequent decays of the $\tau^+$, we work out the effect of the radiative corrections on such distributions in the dominant (one-charged prong) decay channels $ \tau^+ \to \pi^+ \bar{\nu}_\tau, \rho^+ \bar{\nu}_\tau, a_1^+ \bar{\nu}_\tau$ and $\ell^+ \nu_\ell \bar{\nu}_\tau$. The inclusive $\pi^+$ energy spectra in the decay chains $t \to b(W^+,H^+) \to b (\tau^+ \nu_\tau) \to b (\pi^+ \bar{\nu}_\tau \nu_\tau +X)$ are calculated, which can help in searching for the induced $H^\pm$ effects at the Tevatron and the LHC.},

The resulting lepton energy spectrum for the charm semileptonic decay is compared with data to extract the mass of the charm quark. This is combined with the semileptonic branching ratio to predict the charm-quark lifetime. We find the lepton energy spectrum very stable with respect to gluon corrections. Expected spectra from the semileptonic decays of bottom and top quarks are presented. We also study the semileptonic decay process $Q\to ql \nu_l +G$, involving the emission of a single hard non-collinear gluon. This process should be observable with a branching ratio of a few percent in the decays of top (and heavier) quarks.},

We present the analysis of a new data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $240~\pb^{-1}$. We have achieved a reduced systematic uncertainty with respect to previously published KLOE results. From the cross section we obtain the pion form factor and the contribution to the muon magnetic anomaly from two pion states in the mass range $0.592 < M_{\pi\pi} < 0.975~\GeV$. For the latter we find $\Delta a^{\pi\pi}_\mu = (387.2\pm0.5_{\rm stat}\pm2.4_{\rm exp}\pm2.3_{\rm th})\times 10^{-10}$.},

The measured rates for annihilation into various two-body channels and for electromagnetic processes have been used to test simple models for the annihilation mechanism based on the quark internal structure of hadrons. From three-body annihilations three scalar mesons, a0(1450), f0(1370) and f0(1500) have been established in various decay modes. One of them, f0(1500), may be identified with the expected ground state scalar glueball.},

Elastic scatterings were identified by requiring coplanarity and a fit to the scattering kinematics. The detection system was sensitive to scattering angles between 25В° and 75В°. The ratio of the positron cross section to the corresponding electron cross section was 0.992В±0.017 at 800 MeV and 0.987В±0.019 at 1200 MeV.

For Q2<4 (GeV/c)2, where the data overlap with previous measurements, the total uncertainties have been reduced to < 14% in GEp and < 1.5% in GMp. Results for GEp(Q2) are consistent with the dipole fit GD(Q2)=(1+Q2/0.71)-2, while those for mup*GMp(Q2)/GD(Q2) decrease smoothly from 1.05 to 0.92.

It is shown that, in general, the coefficient of the leading asymptotic term depends dynamically on the ratio of the constituent quark mass and the average virtuality of quarks in the vacuum and kinematically on the ratio of photon virtualities. The kinematic dependence of the transition form factor allows us to obtain the relation between the pion light-cone distribution amplitude and the quark-pion vertex function.

The annihilation of electron-positron to the hadronic final state with one additional tagged photon is considered. The radiative corrections are calculated and the numerical estimation is made. Target spin asymmetry and charge asymmetry are investigated for $e\mu$ scattering processes. Initial state radiation (returning to resonance) mechanism is investigated including radiative corrections to initial and final states.

Among the relevant processes we present the splitting of high energy photon in a Coulomb field, calculate the asymptot ics of differential photon photon elastic scattering. We show that LBL mechanism of the four photon mode of neutral pion decay have a dominant role compared, for instance, with the quark loop Feynman amplitude contribution. The mechanisms of creation of t wo and three gluon jets at colliding electro-positron beams is analyzed. We calculate also the contribution of LBL mechanism to the ortho-positronium decay width. One Of the important application is the analytic calculation of the QED contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon arising from LBL mechanism realized through electron positron loops, which is enhanced by the logarithm of the ratio of muon to electron masses. The modification of the QED kernel, which takes into account the QED pol arization operator is used to extract the pure strong interaction contribution. We consider as well the problem of the Coulomb law modification. At second part of review we consider Moeller scattering process and RC to it. We show that RC are in agreement with renormalization group approach and could be taken into account in form of Drell-Yan process cross-section.},

The key feature of this kinematics is that processes have a large cross section which do not decrease with the increasing of the initial center of mass energy. Two purposes to study peripheral processes are: the background processes with large total cross sections and the structure of jets in the fragmentation region. We describe the various QED peripherical processes in terms of Impact Factors and give the explicit expressions for the differential distributions and spin correlation effects, as well as estimates of the total cross section of peripheral processes in photon-photon, photon-lepton and lepton-lepton collisions. A special attention is paid to the small-angle Bhabha scattering process which is relevant for beam monitoring at LEP I, LEP II. Based on analytical properties of the amplitudes some relations (QED sum rules) between the high energy asymptotic of the cross sections of inelastic processes in $e^+e^-$ collisions and higher order perturbative contributions to the electron Dirac and Pauli form-factors are derived.
For practical using we present some loop momentum integrals.},

We evaluate these formulas numerically for 9 different deuteron models: Reid soft core, two Lomon-Feshbach models, three Holinde-Machleidt models, and three four-component relativistic models. All of the models give results for the A structure function considerably below the experimental results; the effect of the relativistic treatment is to reduce the size of A by a factor of 2 to 5 at Q2 of 100 fm-2 over what it would be in the nonrelativistic approximation. We discuss briefly the role of exchange currents; the pair terms are included in our calculation in a completely consistent manner, but the explicit $\rho\pi\gamma$ contributions need to be calculated relativistically. We discuss in some detail the sensitivity of our calculation to the almost unknown neutron electric form factor, observing that a GEn roughly twice GEp in the region of Q2=100 fm-2 would enable us to fit the data even without any $\rho\pi\gamma$ contributions. We discuss the high Q2 limits of our formulas, obtaining the result that the form factor falls one power of Q2 faster than that predicted by the dimensional-scaling-quark model. We also study the low Q2 limits and give explicit formulas for the corrections to the deuteron magnetic and quadrupole moments.

More recently, these radiative corrections have again become a matter of great interest as a possible explanation for the discrepancy between Rosenbluth and polarization transfer measurements of the proton electromagnetic form factors. We have reexamined the electron and positron scattering data to see if they can accommodate two-photon effects of the size necessary to account for the Rosenbluth-polarization transfer discrepancy. The data are consistent with simple estimates of the two-photon contributions necessary to explain the discrepancy. In fact, they strongly favor a large epsilon-dependent correction to the positron to electron ratio, providing the first direct experimental evidence for a two-photon contribution to unpolarized lepton-proton scattering.},

  Abstract                 = {The property of a rho meson in dense nuclear matter is studied using the QCD sum rule. The spectral function appearing on the hadronic side of the sum is evaluated in the vector dominance model that takes into account the interaction between the rho meson and the pion. Including pion modification by the delta-hole polarization in the nuclear medium, we find that as the nuclear density increases the rho meson peak in the spectral function shifts to smaller invariant masses and its width becomes smaller. We discuss the possibility of studying the rho meson property in dense matter via the dilepton invariant mass spectrum from heavy-ion collisions.},

The main characteristics of 3rd and 4th order processes which are relevant for colliding beams, i.e. single and double bremsstrahlung, as well as particle electroproduction, especially pair electroproduction, are given. The corresponding angular and spectral distributions of the final particles, and the integral cross sections are presented and analysed in detail. Some of the higher-order processes as well as some reactions with cross sections decreasing with energy are also discussed. Moreover, radiative effects in narrow resonances production in colliding beam experiments are analysed and methods for the determination of the parameters of these resonances are discussed.
Appendices deal with radiative corrections to cross sections to lower-order in perturbation theory, with approximate methods for the calculation of cross sections for inelastic processes, with substitution rules which relate cross sections for different processes and also with sum rules which connect cross sections of inelastic processes to the electron form factor.},

We show that due to the analytic continuation of the collinear logarithms each eigenfunction of the evolution equation acqiures a phase factor and investigate the resulting interference effects which are shown to be very small. We found no sources for the K-factor-type enhancements in the perturbative QCD contribution to the hadronic form factors. To study the soft part of the pion electromagnetic form factor, we use a QCD sum rule inspired model and show that there are non-canceling Sudakov double logarithms which result in a K-factor-type enhancement in the timelike region.},

  Abstract                 = {All ALEPH measurements of branching ratios of tau decays involving kaons are summarized including a combination of results obtained with K^0_S and K^0_L detection. The decay dynamics are studied, leading to the determination of contributions from vector K^*(892) and K^{*}(1410), and axial-vector K_1(1270) and K_1(1400) resonances. Agreement with isospin symmetry is observed among the different final states. Under the hypothesis of the conserved vector current, the spectral function for the K\bar{K}\pi mode is compared with the corresponding cross section for low energy e^+e^- annihilation, yielding an axial-vector fraction of (94^{+6}_{-8})% for this mode. The branching ratio for tau decay into all strange final states is determined to be B(\tau^-\to X^-(S=-1)\nu_\tau)=(28.7\pm1.2)\times 10^{-3}. The measured mass spectra of the strange tau decay modes are exploited to derive the S=-1 spectral function. A combination of strange and nonstrange spectral functions is used to determine the strange quark mass and nonperturbative contributions to the strange hadronic width. A method is developed to avoid the bad convergence of the spin zero hadronic component, with the result m_s(M_\tau^2)=(176^{+46}_{-57}) MeV/c^2. The evolution down to 1 GeV gives m_s(1 {GeV}^2) = (234^{+61}_{-76}) MeV/c^2.},

The method is based on the use of a simple projection operator which automatically ensures gauge invariance at every stage. The invariant amplitudes for pion photoproduction, pion Compton scattering, and nucleon Compton scattering are found. Previously known results in the first two cases are reproduced and their interpretation is clarified. For nucleon Compton scattering the result is new. Comparisons are made between these invariant amplitudes, the Hearn and Leader amplitudes, and the regularized helicity amplitudes. The Mandelstam representation may be applied to these kinematic-singularity-free and zero-free amplitudes without any ad hoc substractions. All known low-energy theorems on photon processes can be derived most directly from these invariant amplitudes.},

  Abstract                 = {he effects of current quark masses on chiral-symmetry breaking in QCD at finite temperature are examined using a mean-field approximation. The current quark mass plays a role analogous to that of an external magnetic field in the ferromagnetic transition, as it explicitly violates the chiral symmetry whose restoration characterizes the phase transition. For small enough masses, the order parameter, related to the quark condensate, maintains the features of the massless case up to the critical temperature, and then it approaches a constant value depending on the current mass term itself. The consequences on the behavior of the pion mass and decay constant are also studied. Our calculations are done with a variational composite operator approach. We also discuss the critical exponents (in temperature, mass, and for susceptibility) that follow in general from assuming the possible validity of a Landau mean-field theory.},

We calculate this ratio by using an extension to finite chemical potential of the field theoretic composite operator formalism as applied to QCD. The calculation is limited to regions of the phase diagram where only quark-antiquark condensates dominate (no quark-quark condensates) and it confirms the expected behaviours. In particular the sigma becomes an essentially stable particle in a narrow region bordering the transition line from broken to restored chirality. This pattern is qualitatively the same both for the region where the transition is of second order as for the region where it is of first order (apart from the discontinuities expected in the latter case).},

In particular the ratio of the sigma mass to the pion mass is an interesting measure of the degree of chiral symmetry breaking at different temperatures. We calculate the temperature T* at which M_sigma(T) < 2M_pi(T), above which the sigma partial width into two pions vanishes. We find T*=0.95T_c (where T_c is the critical temperature for the chiral phase transition), within the full effective potential given by the formalism.

The continuous chiral symmetry of the model plays a crucial role, and the thermodynamics leads to a broken phase with a periodic spiral condensate, the "chiral spiral", as a thermodynamically preferred limit of the more general "twisted kink crystal" solution of the gap equation. This situation should be contrasted with the Gross-Neveu model, which has a discrete chiral symmetry, and for which the phase diagram has a crystalline phase with a periodic kink crystal. We use a combination of analytic, numerical and Ginzburg-Landau techniques to study various parts of the phase diagram.},

We discuss consequences of the target and lepton beam polarizations for accessing the generalized parton distributions from experimental measurements of the azimuthal angular dependence of the final state photon or nucleon. We introduce several sets of asymmetries, defined as Fourier moments with respect to the azimuthal angle, which allow for a clear separation of the twist-two and -three sectors. Relying on a simple ansatz for the generalized parton distributions, we give quantitative estimates for azimuthal and spin asymmetries, discuss the uncertainties of these predictions brought in by radiative corrections, and compare them with experimental data as well as other theoretical expectations. Furthermore, we derive a general parametrization of the DVCS amplitudes in the region of small Bjorken variable.},

We show that isospin symmetry breaking effects on pseudoscalar mesons naturally induces correspondingly effects within the physics of vector mesons, through kaon loops. In this way, one recovers all features traditionally expected from $\rho-\omg$ mixing and one finds support for the Orsay phase modelling of the $e^+e^- \ra \pi^+ \pi^-$ amplitude. We then examine an effective procedure which generates mixing in the whole $\rho$, $\omg$, $\phi$ sector of the HLS Model. The corresponding model allows us to account for all two body decays of light mesons accessible to the HLS model in modulus and phase, leaving aside the $\rho \ra \pi \pi$ and $K^* \ra K \pi$ modes only, which raise a specific problem. Comparison with experimental data is performed and covers modulus and phase information; this represents 26 physics quantities successfully described with very good fit quality within a constrained model which accounts for SU(3) breaking, nonet symmetry breaking in the pseudoscalar sector and, now, isospin symmetry breaking.},

A highlight of the Fundamental Symmetries subfield of the 2007 NSAC Long Range Plan was the SLAC E158 measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry $A_{PV}$ in polarized electron-electron (M{\o}ller) scattering. The proposed MOLLER experiment will improve on this result by a factor of five, yielding the most precise measurement of the weak mixing angle at low or high energy anticipated over the next decade. This new result would be sensitive to the interference of the electromagnetic amplitude with new neutral current amplitudes as weak as $\sim 10^{-3} \dot G_F$ from as yet undiscovered dynamics beyond the Standard Model. The resulting discovery reach is unmatched by any proposed experiment measuring a flavor- and CP-conserving process over the next decade, and yields a unique window to new physics at MeV and multi-TeV scales, complementary to direct searches at high energy colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The experiment takes advantage of the unique opportunity provided by the upgraded electron beam energy, luminosity, and stability at Jefferson Laboratory and the extensive experience accumulated in the community after a round of recent successfully completed parity-violating electron scattering experiments},

They can be written as a product of two factors: one factor is connected with the lowest order, elastic process, and the second one is related to the infrared factor which describes soft quantum emission. We present explicit formulae for various processes.},

  Abstract                 = {The corrections to muon decay due to electromagnetic interactions have been recalculated. Our results differ from those of Behrends, Finkelstein, and Sirlin, because those authors used an inconsistent method for handling the infrared divergences which arise separately in the real and virtual processes. The disagreement is especially significant near the end of the electron (positron) spectrum where our results indicate that the radiative correction to the Michel $\rho$ parameter is approximately $1\%$ larger than previously supposed, a result in the direction of increasing agreement between experiment and theory. With the radiative corrections to muon decay given here, the predicted value of the muon lifetime using the universal theory is $(2.27\pm 0.04)\times 10^{-6} sec$. As a preliminary to studying the decay of particles with structure, the $\beta$ decay of the neutron is examined. This leads to an increase in the Coulomb $F$ factor independent of the nuclear charge and of amount approximately 2.6%. As a result the universal coupling constant obtained from the decay of $O^14$ is decreased to $G=(1.37 \om 0.02) \times 10^{-49} erg cm3$ and increases the value of the muon lifetime to $(2.33 \pm 0.05) \times 10^{-6} sec$.},

  Abstract                 = {A general procedure for extracting exact spectral-function sum rules is presented. The short-distance behavior of products of vector and axial-vector currents is related to the convergence (or superconvergence) of the original first and second spectral sum rules together with a third sum rule involving only the spin-0 spectral function. The operator-product expansion is then applied to determine all (and only) those linear combinations of current propagators for which the short-distance behavior is sufficiently soft to yield superconvergent sum rules for the corresponding combinations of spectral functions. Our method is applied to determine the complete set of sum rules for a theory defined by a global chiral $SU(4) \times SU(4)$ symmetry, broken (a) explicitly by hadron (quark) masses and (b) by dynamical symmetry breaking to any subgroup containing the symmetry group of the mass matrix. Our derivation is strictly true only for asymptotically free theories, but the results are expected to apply for a range of other theories. The method is easily extended to deal with current propagators involving scalar and pseudoscalar densities (not necessarily divergences of vector or axial-vector currents)вЂ”the relevant sum rules in the context of the $SU(4) \times SU(4)$ model are derived. Finally, we compare our approach and results to those of several recent studies of the spectral-function sum rules. An appendix presents a proof that Wilson functions exhibit the full symmetries of any theory, whether or not these are spontaneously broken.},

The required enhancement can be ascribed to a dressing of the quark-gluon vertex. The solutions of the rainbow gap equation exhibit dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and are consistent with confinement. The gap equation and related, symmetry-preserving ladder Bethe-Salpeter equation yield estimates for chiral and physical pion observables that suggest these quantities are materially underestimated in the quenched theory: |<bar-q q>| by a factor of two and f_pi by 30%.},

In particular, by using the various prescriptions of a temperature-dependent shear viscosity to the entropy ratio, we show that the hydrodynamic description of the relativistic fluid become invalid due to the phenomenon of cavitation. For most of the initial conditions relevant for LHC, the cavitation sets in very early during the evolution of the hydrodynamics in time $\lesssim 2 $fm/c. The cavitation in this case is entirely driven by the large values of shear viscosity. Moreover we also demonstrate that the conformal term used in equations of the relativistic dissipative hydrodynamic can influence the cavitation time.},

We argue that the infinite-momentum limit for these commutators does not diverge, but may vanish. If the limit is nonvanishing, we predict $\nu W_2(\nu, q^2) \to f_2(\nu/q^2)$ and $W_1(\nu, q^2) \to f_1(\nu/q^2)$ as $\nu$ and $q^2$ tend to $\infty$. From a similar analysis for neutrino processes, we conclude that at high energies the total neutrino-nucleon cross sections rise linearly with neutrino laboratory energy until nonlocality of the weak current-current coupling sets in. The sum of $\nu p$ and $\bar \nu p$ cross sections is determined by the equal-time commutator of the Cabibbo current with its time derivative, taken between proton states at infinite momentum.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous methods of treating radiative corrections in non-stationary processes such as the scattering of an electron in an atomic field or the emission of a $\beta$-ray, by an expansion in powers of $e^2/\hbar c$, are defective in that they predict infinite low frequency corrections to the transition probabilities. This difficulty can be avoided by a method developed here which is based on the alternative assumption that $e^2\omega/mc^3$, $\hbar\omega/mc^2$ and $\hbar\omega/c\Delta p$ ($\omega$ = angular frequency of radiation, $\Delta p$ = change in momentum of electron) are small compared to unity. In contrast to the expansion in powers of $e^2/\hbar c$, this permits the transition to the classical limit $\hbar =0$. External perturbations on the electron are treated in the Born approximation. It is shown that for frequencies such that the above three parameters are negligible the quantum mechanical calculation yields just the directly reinterpreted results of the classical formulae, namely that the total probability of a given change in the motion of the electron is unaffected by the interaction with radiation, and that the mean number of emitted quanta is infinite in such a way that the mean radiated energy is equal to the energy radiated classically in the corresponding trajectory.},

The two-colour theory, QC2D, is an excellent exemplar: the order of truncation of the quark-quark scattering kernel: K, has no qualitative impact, which allows a straightforward elucidation of the effects of mu when the coupling is strong. In rainbow-ladder truncation, diquark bound states appear in the spectrum of the three-colour theory, a defect that is eliminated by an improvement of K. The corrected gap equation describes a superfluid phase that is semi-quantitatively similar to that obtained using the rainbow truncation. A model study suggests that the width of the superfluid gap and the transition point in QC2D provide reliable quantitative estimates of those quantities in QCD.},

Deviations from the parton model predictions are found due to soft-gluon color exchange. In the interference (i.e. $1/N_c$) terms they are stronger than in the non-interference terms. The sign is negative so that the $1/N_c$ parts tend to cancel. The absolute value of the effect is of order 1 in D-mesons and of order 0.50 in B mesons.},

Precision data are becoming available from the KLOE experiment at the DAPHNE machine at Frascati, as well as results from SND and CMD-2 at VEPP-2M at Novosibirsk. We show how the coupling of the f_0(980) to this channel can be extracted from these, independently of the background provided by sigma production. To do this we use the fact that the behaviour of both the f_0(980) and sigma cannot be determined by these data alone, but is strongly constrained by experimental results from other hadronic processes as required by unitarity. We find that the resulting coupling for the phi -> gamma f_0(980) is about 10^{-4} GeV with a background that is quite unlike that assumed if unitarity is neglected. This provides an object lesson in how unitarity teaches us to add resonances. Not surprisingly the result is crucially dependent on the pole position of the f_0(980), for which there are still sizeable uncertainties. At present this leads to an uncertainty in the phi -> f_0 gamma branching ratio which can only be fixed by further precision data on the f_0(980).},

Two photon results from Mark II, Crystal Ball and CELLO prompt a new Amplitude Analysis of $\gamma\gamma\to\pi^+\pi^-$, $\pi^0\pi^0$ cross-sections. Despite their currently limited angular coverage and lack of polarized photons, we use a methodology that provides the nearest one can presently achieve to a model-independent partial wave separation. We find two distinct classes of solutions. Both have very similar two photon couplings for the $f_0(980)$ and $f_0(400-1200)$. Hopefully these definitive results will be a spur to dynamical calculations that will bring us a better understanding of these important states.},

The condition of stability with respect to small quantum fluctuations is formulated as the requirement that there should be no solutions of the Heisenberg equation that increase with time. It is shown that if the charge vector of the source is oriented in a definite direction in the color space, only solutions with complete screening will be stable.},

The expression for the elastic contribution to the amplitude, obtained in our approach, differs from the results of traditional calculations with on-shell form factors.

The prediction for the ratio $R=\Gamma(\tau \to \nu_\tau+hadrons)/\Gamma(\tau \to \nu_\tau+e-+\bar\nu_e)$ is $3.29$, with an uncertainty of about 1% due to the uncertainty in the $\Lambda$ parameter of QCD. Nonperturbative corrections to this prediction are estimated to be on the order of 1%. More importantly, these corrections are shown to be negative because of a fortuitous cancellation of the leading contribution from the gluon condensate. The resulting prediction is significantly smaller than the present experimental result $R=3.65 \pm 0.13$.},

It is shown that at the one-loop level of the SM the muon transverse polarization, $P_T^{SM}$, varies within $(0.0 \div 1.1 \cdot 10^{-3})$ in the Dalitz plot region. Averaged value of the muon polarization, $<P^{SM}_T>$, in the kinematic region of $E_\gamma \geq 20$ MeV is equal to $4.76\cdot 10^{-4}$. In the case of the model with three Higgs doublets the muon transverse polarization is calculated as a function of charged Higgs masses, imaginary part of the Yukawa coupling constants product and vacuum expectation values of the Higgs doublets. The averaged value of the transverse polarization in the Weinberg model is $<P^{Higgs}_T > = - 6.62 \cdot 10^{-5}$. Perspectives to probe the effect caused by the charged Higgs exchange diagrams in planned kaon experiments are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The complementarity between Chiral Perturbation Theory and the Linear Sigma Model is exploited to study $\pi^0\pi^0$ production in $\phi$ radiative decays, where the effects of the $f_0(980)$ scalar resonance, and those of its more controversial $\sigma(500)$ partner, should become manifest via the $\phi\to K^+ K^- (\gamma)\to\pi^0\pi^0\gamma $ decay chain. The recently reported data on $\phi\to\pi^0\pi^0\gamma$ coming from the VEPP-2M $e^+ e^-$ collider in Novosibirsk and the DA$\Phi$NE $\phi$-factory in Frascati can be reasonably described in our approach, which we propose as a promising first step towards more detailed analyses. The $f_0(980)$ contribution, which appears as a moderately narrow peak at the high part of the dipion mass spectrum, can be interpreted as the isoscalar member of the scalar nonet with a large $f_0 K\bar{K}$ coupling and an $f_0\pi\pi$ coupling suppressed by almost ideal $\sigma$-$f_0$ mixing. Indeed, the mixing angle in the flavour basis is found to be $\phi_{S}\approx -6^\circ$, if the $f_0$-propagator is approximated by a simple Breit-Wigner, or $\phi_{S}\approx -9^\circ$, if an improved two-channel analysis is performed. The $\sigma(500)$ resonance, which is then strongly coupled to pion pairs, yields a tiny contribution because, in our approach, its coupling to kaon pairs is proportional to $m^2_\sigma-m^2_K$ and thus quite small.},

  Abstract                 = {We discuss a possible interpretation of the f0(980) meson as a hadronic molecule - a bound state of K and bar K mesons. Using a phenomenological Lagrangian approach we calculate the strong f0(980) to pi pi and electromagnetic f0(980) to gamma gamma decays. The compositeness condition provides a self-consistent method to determine the coupling constant between f0 and its constituents, K and bar K. Form factors governing the decays of the f0(980) are calculated by evaluating the kaon loop integrals. The predicted f0(980) to pi pi and f0(980) to gamma gamma decay widths are in good agreement with available data and results of other theoretical approaches.},

We give the precise relationship of the process $e+e \to e+e+X$ ($X$ is any $C=+$ state) to the corresponding two-photon annihilation process $\gamma+\gamma \to X$, as well as a careful derivation of the equivalent-photon approximation. In the case of the $\pi^0$ production, we have found that, for the beam energy E in the 1-3 GeV range, the exact total cross section is 20-30\% larger than the one calculated previously in the equivalent-photon approximation. However, the introduction of form factors cuts down the exact total cross section, reducing it to within 10\% of the equivalent-photon-approximation result. For $\eta$ production the agreement is even better. Thus it appears that the use of the equivalent-photon approximation is justified in most cases. We discuss detailed angular distributions in this approximation for the case of $\pi^+\pi^-$ production. One important problem which cannot be adequately studied in the equivalent-photon approximation is the degree of noncoplanarity of the $\pi^+\pi^-$ (and the $\mu^+\mu^-$) pair. We have studied this problem using the exact formula and found that, for E=1 GeV, typically 40-50\% of pion pairs will be produced with the noncoplanarity angle greater than $12^o$. We discuss the general structure of the $\gamma+\gamma \to \pi^+\pi^-$ amplitude as well as a simple model incorporating the $\sigma$ meson. We also give a rough estimate of multihadron production cross sections.},

A cross section of the same order has also been obtained for double Compton scattering in which one of the emitted photons has an energy small compared to the rest mass of the electron (with the electron initially at rest). This contains a term depending on $\ln\lambda$ which exactly compensates the similar term arising from virtual quanta in all observable cases.

Earlier calculations of Bludman and Young have been extended by including, as a phenomenological parameter, the axial-vector contribution relative to polar-vector, and by calculating integrals of the decay rate over various portions of phase space likely to be measured. The experiments can be analyzed in terms of the $\pi\rho$ coupling to the axial-vector current. We conclude that the recent experiments of Depommier et al. establish the presence of such axial-vector structure contributing to the decay, but that one cannot assign this component to a weak-interacting vector meson rather than to strong-interaction structure.},

The basic method for extracting information on the gamma gamma --> h (hadrons) transition - the ee --> eeh reaction - is discussed in detail. In particular, we discuss what information on the gamma gamma --> h transition can be extracted from the related experiments and how it can be done. One examines which questions in hadrodynamics and photohadron interaction physics can be answered by such investigations. It is emphasized that their main peculiarity is the possibility of investigating dependence of the amplitude on the energy as well as on the masses of both colliding particles (photons).
The applications of two-photon lepton production in experimental high energy physics are discussed (the form factor investigation, the search for the real part of some forward scattering amplitudes, some auxiliary problems, etc.). Applications to the search for new (hypothetical) particles are considered.
A number of important differential distributions are given. Cross section estimations for different for different experimental set ups are obtained. A critical discussion of the equivalent photon approximation is given.},

The effect of using various decay distributions and their correlations in the $\tau$ polarisation measurements in $Z \to \tau^-\tau^+$ is studied quantitatively.

In QCD we assume that the gluon vacuum is realized by the selfdual homogeneous classical field which is the solution of the Yang-Mills equations. This assumption leads to analytical confinement of quarks and gluons. We extract the colorless 0(++) two-glouon state from the QCD generating functional in the one-gluon exchange approximation. The mass of this bound state is defined by the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The glueball mass varies in the region 1470{Mev} - 1600{Mev} for QCD coupling constant in the region 0.2 - 0.5 if the gluon condensate is 0.012 Gev^4.},

The model being a kind of nonlocal extension of the bosonization procedure is based on the hypothesis that the QCD vacuum is realized by the (anti-)self-dual homogeneous gluon field. This vacuum field provides the analytical quark confinement. It is shown that a particular form of nonlocality of the quark and gluon propagators determined by the vacuum field, an interaction of quark spin with the vacuum gluon field and a localization of meson field at the center of masses of two quarks can explain the distinctive features of meson spectrum: Regge trajectories of radial and orbital excitations, mass splitting between pseudoscalar and vector mesons, the asymptotic mass formulas in the heavy quark limit: $M_{Q\bar Q}\to 2m_Q$ for quarkonia and $M_{Q\bar q}\to m_Q$ for heavy-light mesons. With a minimal set of parameters (quark masses, vacuum field strength and the quark-gluon coupling constant) the model describes to within ten percent inaccuracy the masses and weak decay constants of mesons from all qualitatively different regions of the spectrum.},

Minimum-$\chi^2$ fits to the measured $(E_{e^+},E_\gamma)$ energy distributions result in the weak form factor value of $F_A=0.0119(1)$ with a fixed value of $F_V=0.0259$. An unconstrained fit yields $F_V=0.0258(17)$ and $F_A=0.0117(17)$. In addition, we have measured $a=0.10(6)$ for the dependence of $F_V$ on $q^2$, the ${\rm e}^{+}\nu$ pair invariant mass squared, parametrized as $F_V(q^2)=F_V(0)(1+a\cdot q^2)$. The branching ratio for the kinematic region $E_\gamma > 10 $MeV and $\theta_{{\rm e^+}\gamma} > 40^\circ $ is measured to be $B^{\rm exp}=73.86(54) \times 10^{-8}$. Earlier deviations we reported in the high-$E_\gamma$/low-$E_{{\rm e}^+}$ kinematic region are resolved, and we find full compatibility with CVC and standard $V$$-$$A$ calculations without a tensor term. We also derive new values for the pion polarizability, $\alpha_E = \rm 2.78(10) \times 10^{-4} fm^3$, and neutral pion lifetime, $\tau_{\pi 0} = (8.5 \pm 1.1) \times 10^{-17} $s.},

  Abstract                 = {In frames of agreement to consider the annihilation of electron-positron pair to hadrons cross section to be including the virtual photon polarization effects a new formulation of hadron contribution to muon anomalous magnetic moment is suggested. It consists in using the experimentally observed cross section converted with the known kernels. The lowest order kernel remains to be the same but some modification of radiative corrected kernel is needed. The explicit form of this new kernel is given. We estimate the accuracy of new formulation on the level \delta a^{hadr}_\mu/a^{hadr}_\mu \sim 10^{-5}.},

The expression of the cross section is formally similar to the cross section of the Drell-Yan process, where the structure functions of the electron play the role of Drell-Yan probability distributions. The interference of the Born amplitude with the two photon exchange amplitude (box-type diagrams) is expressed as a contribution to K-factor and it is larger when the momentum is equally shared between the two photons, assuming that proton form factors decrease rapidly with the momentum transfer squared. The calculation of the box amplitude is done when the intermediate state is a proton or the Delta-resonance. The results of numerical estimations show that the present calculation of radiative corrections can bring into agreement the conflicting experimental results on proton electromagnetic form factors an that the two photon contribution is very small.},

It corresponds to the kinematics where the vector meson is emitted close to the direction of one of the colliding leptons, while the direction of the other lepton remains close to the initial one. The annihilation channel contribution is enhanced by the initial hard photon emission mechanism. It occurs in the kinematical region where the final particles are emitted at large angles and plays the role of background.

Many of these contributions can be still expressed as a convolution integral over the total $e^+e^- \to hadrons$ cross section $\sigma_H(t)$ and are thus reliably estimated. The rest of the contributions, which involve the light by light hadronic amplitude, have been calculated within a SU(3)color $\times$ SU(4)flavor scheme. For the total hadronic contribution to $\alpha_\mu$, which also includes the dominant hadronic corrections as well as an estimate, using asymptotic freedom, of the induced contribution from the asymptotic behaviour of $\sigma_H(\sqrt{s}>7.4 GeV)$ we obtain $\alpha_\mu(hadrons)=(66.4 \pm 10.2)\times10^{-9}$.},

With the help of the operator product expansion we also perform the resummation of the leading and next-to-leading logarithms of the standard QCD corrections. We use these resummation procedures to compute the radiative corrections to the $t\to b H^+$ , Image decay rates. In the large $\tan\beta$ regime, we derive simple formulae embodying all the dominant contributions to these decay rates and we compute the corresponding branching ratios. We show, as an example, the effect of these new results on determining the region of the $M_{H^+} - \tan\beta$ plane excluded by the Tevatron searches for a supersymmetric charged Higgs boson in top quark decays, as a function of the MSSM parameter space.},

Also present is a state with both manners of condensation, however this phase is found to be thermodynamically disfavoured for equilibrium matter. Properties of quark matter in each phase are discussed, with emphasis on the microscopic effects of the effective mass and superconducting energy gap.},

  Abstract                 = {We continue our studies of a relativistic quark model that features chiral symmetry, covariance, and confinement. In this work we apply our model to the study of scalar-isoscalar mesons. Several of the parameters of the model have been determined in our earlier work, so that only two new parameters are needed for our analysis. We find a good fit to the spectrum of the $f_0$ mesons, if we add a glueball with energy of about $1700~\MeV$. In this model we are rather close to "ideal mixing,'' with the $f_0(980)$ having the largest $s\bar s$ mixture of $10\%$. The $f_0(1370)$ is the nodeless $s\bar s$ state, while the $f_0(1500)$ is a $n\bar n=(u\bar u+d\bar d)/2$ state with a single node. [The presence of that node accounts for the small width of the $f_0(1500)$.] The next state is a $n\bar n$ state with two nodes at $1843~\MeV$. Thus, we identify the $f_0(1770)$ as the state with the largest glueball component. It was found that the vacuum polarization functions that describe coupling to the two-meson and other continuum meson channels play an important role in achieving a good fit to the experimentally determined spectrum. In this work we use a Gaussian regulator in all our calculations of meson decay amplitudes. In the first part of our study we multiply the Gaussian regulator by a $P^2$-dependent factor that was chosen so as to modify the threshold behavior of our polarization functions. With that factor in place, we can study the spectrum of f0 states without introducing the imaginary parts of the polarization functions that describe decay to the two-meson continuum. When we do introduce the imaginary parts, we use the vacuum polarization functions with unmodified threshold behavior. The use of the $P^2$-dependent factor helps to clarify the nature of the $f_0(400-1200)$, which is seen, in part, to have its origin as a rather complex threshold effect associated with the rapid increase of the amplitudes for decay to the $\pi\pi$ and $K\bar K$ channels. [For a full understanding of the $f_0(400-1200)$ one needs to also consider the role of $t$-channel $\rho$ exchange.] The model used in this work is based upon weak quarkonium-glueball coupling. However, the four-pion decay of the $f_0(1370)$ and the $f_0(1500)$ suggests that these states may be strongly mixed with the glueball, which may have a large four-pion decay width. It is also possible that mixing of these states with the $f_0(980)$ may be important for understanding the four-pion decay widths. We provide a short discussion of quarkonium-glueball mixing in a schematic model. There is not enough information presently available to treat that problem in an unambiguous manner.},

  Abstract                 = {A superconductor is a material that conducts electric current with no resistance. Superconductivity and magnetism are known to be antagonistic phenomena: superconductors expel weak external magnetic field (the Meissner effect) while a sufficiently strong magnetic field, in general, destroys superconductivity. In a seemingly contradictory statement, we show that a very strong magnetic field can turn an empty space into a superconductor. The external magnetic field required for this effect should be about 10^{16} Tesla (eB ~ 1 GeV^2). The physical mechanism of the exotic vacuum superconductivity is as follows: in strong magnetic field the dynamics of virtual quarks and antiquarks is effectively one-dimensional because these electrically charged particles tend to move along the lines of the magnetic field. In one spatial dimension a gluon-mediated attraction between a quark and an antiquark of different flavors inevitably leads to formation of a colorless spin-triplet bound state (a vector analogue of the Cooper pair) with quantum numbers of an electrically charged rho meson. Such quark-antiquark pairs condense to form an anisotropic inhomogeneous superconducting state similar to the Abrikosov vortex lattice in a type-II superconductor. The onset of the superconductivity of the charged rho mesons should also induce an inhomogeneous superfluidity of the neutral rho mesons. The vacuum superconductivity should survive at very high temperatures of typical Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) scale of 10^{12} K (T ~ 100 MeV). We propose the phase diagram of QCD in the plane "magnetic field - temperature".},

Binding complications are absent if a plausible assumption about the location and residues of poles in the S matrix is accepted. The method is useful for unstable particles from which free targets cannot be made; the special examples of pion and neutron targets are discussed in detail.},

Given the importance of these processes for both hadron spectroscopy and CP-violation studies at $\phi$ factories (where $\phi \rightarrow K^0 \bar K^0 \gamma$ poses a possible background problem), this state of affairs is very undesirable. We show that the variety of predictions is due in part to errors and in part to differences in modelling. The latter variation leads us to argue that the radiative decays of these scalar states are interesting in their own right and may offer unique insights into the nature of the scalar mesons. As a byproduct we find that the branching ratio for $\phi\rightarrow K^0\bar{K}^0\gamma$ is $\lapproxeq 0(10^{-7})$ and will pose no significant background to proposed studies of CP-violation.},

To isolate the most important color-charge terms at the horizon and investigate their influence on quantum eigenstates, a simple nonlinear transformation is introduced which removes the horizon to infinity. The results of some numerical calculations on the shape of the horizon are also reported.},

  Abstract                 = {In the present paper a model of preons and their composites is constructed in the framework of the superstring-inspired `flipped' E_6\times \widetilde{E_6} gauge symmetry group which reveals a generalized dual symmetry. Here E_6 and \widetilde{E_6} are non-dual and dual sectors of the theory with hyper-electric g and hyper-magnetic \tilde g charges, respectively. We follow the old idea by J. Pati presuming that preons are dyons, which in our model are confined by hyper-magnetic strings -- composite {\bf N}=1 supersymmetric non-Abelian flux tubes created by the condensation of spreons near the Planck scale. Considering preons belonging to the 27-plet of E_6, we have investigated the breakdown of E_6 (and \widetilde{E_6}) near the Planck scale into the SU(6)\times U(1) (and \widetilde{SU(6)}\times \widetilde{U(1)}) gauge group and shown that the six types of strings having fluxes \Phi_n=n\Phi_0 (n=\pm 1,\pm 2,\pm 3) produce three (and only three) generations of composite quark-leptons and bosons. The model predicts the existence of the Family replicated gauge group [E_6]^3 near the Planck scale. The runnings of the corresponding fine structure constants are investigated, and the critical coupling constants at the two phase transition points near the Planck scale are calculated. The model explains the hierarchies of masses in the Standard Model naturally. The compactification in a space-time with five dimensions and its influence on form-factors of composite objects are also briefly discussed.},

The relevant analytical results are listed, and a numerical evaluation is presented for the unpolarized and polarized cross sections as well as for polarization asymmetries. The relative weak corrections are typically of the order of 10%. At low energies, the bulk of the corrections is due to the running of the electromagnetic coupling constant. For left-handed electrons, at high energies the vertex and box corrections involving virtual W bosons become very important. The polarization asymmetry is considerably reduced by the weak radiative corrections.},

The experiment, which used the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer and longitudinally polarized proton (View the MathML source) and deuteron (View the MathML source) targets, collected data with a longitudinally polarized electron beam at energies between 1.6 GeV and 5.7 GeV. In the present Letter, we concentrate on our results for A1(x,Q2) and the related ratio g1/F1(x,Q2) in the resonance and the deep inelastic regions for our lowest and highest beam energies, covering a range in momentum transfer Q2 from 0.05 to View the MathML source and in final-state invariant mass W up to about 3 GeV. Our data show detailed structure in the resonance region, which leads to a strong Q2-dependence of A1(x,Q2) for W below 2 GeV. At higher W, a smooth approach to the scaling limit, established by earlier experiments, can be seen, but A1(x,Q2) is not strictly Q2-independent. We add significantly to the world data set at high x, up to x=0.6. Our data exceed the SU(6)-symmetric quark model expectation for both the proton and the deuteron while being consistent with a negative d-quark polarization up to our highest x. This data set should improve next-to-leading order (NLO) pQCD fits of the parton polarization distributions.},

  Abstract                 = {We calculate exactly functional determinants for quantum oscillations about periodic instantons with non-trivial value of the Polyakov line at spatial infinity. Hence, we find the weight or the probability with which calorons with non-trivial holonomy occur in the Yang--Mills partition function. The weight depends on the value of the holonomy, the temperature, Lambda_QCD, and the separation between the BPS monopoles (or dyons) which constitute the periodic instanton. At large separation between constituent dyons, the quantum measure factorizes into a product of individual dyon measures, times a definite interaction energy. We present an argument that at temperatures below a critical one related to Lambda_QCD, trivial holonomy is unstable, and that calorons ``ionize'' into separate dyons.},

The ensemble is governed by an exactly solvable 3d quantum field theory, allowing calculation of correlations functions relevant to confinement. We show that known criteria of confinement are satisfied in this semiclassical approximation: (i) the average Polyakov line is zero below some critical temperature, and nonzero above it, (ii) a quark-antiquark pair has linear rising potential energy, (iii) the average spatial Wilson loop falls off exponentially with the area, (iv) N^2 gluons are canceled out from the spectrum, (v) the critical deconfinement temperature is in good agreement with lattice data. Using the same approximation, we find confinement for the exceptional gauge group G(2) and a first-order deconfinement transition, also in agreement with lattice findings.},

We first examine the two-flavor case within the Hartree + random phase approximation in order to (a) develop the formalism necessary for the treatment of the three-flavor case, and (b) to see if the scalar sector can be treated as ideally mixed, i.e., if the $u$, $d$ quark mesons completely separate themselves from the ones with strange quarks. Then we calculate the scalar and pseudoscalar meson mass spectra in the three-flavor model within the mean-field approximation and establish relations between the scalar and pseudoscalar meson masses. This analysis leads to a new approximate sum rule that is a consequence of $U_A(1)$ breaking in the NambuвЂ“Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model: $m_{\eta'}^2+m_\eta^2-2m_K^2 \prop -m_{f_0'}^2-m_{f_0}^2 +2m_{K_0^*}^2$, where $\eta'$, $\eta$,$K$ are the observed pseudoscalar mesons, $K_0^*$ is the strange scalar meson at $1430~\MeV$, and $f_0$, $f_0'$ are вЂ�вЂ�the eighth and the ninthвЂ™вЂ™ scalar mesons. It states that the mass splitting between the scalar singlet and the octet is of the same size as, but of opposite sign to, the corresponding splitting among the pseudoscalars. We discuss the large-NC limit of our results. Two of our partial results leading to the sum rule are consistent with the large-NC limit results of QCD, though one of them is not required by QCD.},

  Abstract                 = {The mass difference between the charged and the neutral pions that arises from chiral symmetry-breaking effects on these particles considered as Goldstone modes of the two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model is studied in the Hartree plus random phase approximation. Most of the pion mass difference originates from the pions' electromagnetic self-energy that is due to the electromagnetic interactions of the constituent quarks that make up the pion, with only a very small additional "mechanical"' contribution, proportional to the square of their mass difference, coming from the current quark masses. We discuss the gauge invariance of this self-energy and the residual chiral symmetry of the theory in the presence of electromagnetic fields in the limit of vanishing current quark masses, and prove the Goldberger-Treiman relation between $O(\alpha EM)$-corrected quantities in this limit for the neutral pion. We elucidate the special role that the electromagnetic contributions to the constituent quark mass play in keeping the neutral pion massless in the chiral limit in the presence of its own internal electromagnetic fields in agreement with Dashen's theorem. The lowest order nonchiral electromagnetic corrections to the mass shifts are repulsive and contain "chiral logarithms'' of the meson mass $m_\pi$ of the form $\alpha m_\pi^2 \ln m_\pi^2$ in the charged channel in accord with the Langacker-Pagels general analysis. By contrast, the neutral pion's mass is only shifted by terms of $O(\alpha m_\pi^2)$, resulting in a very weak nonchiral breaking of Dashen's theorem. We evaluate the corrections numerically and show that the relative sizes of the electromagnetic chiral, the nonchiral logarithm, and the remaining $O(\alpha m_\pi^2)$ plus mechanical contributions make up approximately 90\%, 9\%, and 1\% of the observed pion mass splitting, respectively.},

A formula for $\beta_c$ is obtained in terms of the renormalized parameters of the theory. By examining a large subset of graphs, we show that the formula is accurate for weak coupling. An approximate gap equation is derived whose solutions describe the theory near the critical point. For gauge theories, special attention is given to ensure gauge invariance of physical quantities.

  Abstract                 = {Measuring the lepton anomalous magnetic moments $(g-2)$ and the rare decays of light pseudoscalar mesons into lepton pairs $P\to l^{+}l^{-} $, serve as important tests of the Standard Model. To reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the standard model predictions, the data on the charge and transition form factors of the light pseudoscalar mesons play a significant role. Recently, new data on the behavior of the transition form factors $P\to\gamma\gamma* $ at large momentum transfer were supplied by the BABAR collaboration. There are several problems with the theoretical interpretation of these data: 1) An unexpectedly slow decrease of the pion transition form factor at high momenta, 2) the qualitative difference in the behavior of the pion form factor and the $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ form factors at high momenta, 3) the inconsistency of the measured ratio of the $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ form factors with the predicted one. We comment on the influence of the new BABAR data on the rare decay branchings.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, the BABAR collaboration published (arXiv:0905.4778) data for the photon-pion transition form factor $F_{\pi\gamma\gamma^{\ast}}(Q^{2})$, which are in strong contradiction to the predictions of the standard factorization approach to perturbative QCD. Immediately afterwards, two mechanisms were suggested (A.E. Dorokhov, arXiv:0905.4577; A.V. Radyushkin, arXiv:0906.0323), that logarithmically enhance the form factor asymptotics and therefore provide a qualitatively satisfactory description of the BABAR data. However, the physics of the BABAR effect was not fully clarified. In the present work, based on a nonperturbative approach to the QCD vacuum and on rather universal assumptions, we show that there exists two asymptotic regimes for the pion transition form factor. One regime with asymptotics $F_{\pi\gamma^{\ast}\gamma}(Q^{2})\sim1/Q^{2}$ corresponds to the result of the standard QCD factorization approach, while other violates the standard factorization and leads to asymptotic behavior as $F_{\pi\gamma^{\ast}\gamma}(Q^{2})\sim\ln(Q^{2})Q^{2}$. Furthermore, considering specific nonlocal chiral quark models, we find the region of parameters, where the existing CELLO, CLEO and BABAR data for the pion transition form factor are successfully described.},

  Abstract                 = {Within the dispersive approach to the amplitude of the rare decay pi0 -> e+e- the nontrivial dynamics is contained only in the subtraction constant. We express this constant, in the leading order in (m_e/\Lambda)^2 perturbative series, in terms of the inverse moment of the pion transition form factor given in symmetric kinematics. By using the CELLO and CLEO data on the pion transition form factor given in asymmetric kinematics the lower bound on the decay branching ratio is found. The restrictions following from QCD allow us to make a quantitative prediction for the branching B(pi0 -> e+e-) =(6.2\pm 0.1)*10^{-8} which is 3\sigma below the recent KTeV measurement. We confirm our prediction by using the quark models and phenomenological approaches based on the vector meson dominance. The decays \eta -> l^+l^- are also discussed.},

One kind of RC investigated earlier has a renormalization group origin and can be associated with the final state interaction of electron and positron. It determines the distribution of lepton pair invariant masses in the whole kinematic region. The other type of RC has a double-logarithmic character and is related to almost on-mass-shell behavior of the lepton form factors. The total effect of RC for the $\pi^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}$ decay is estimated to be 3.2% and for the decay $\eta \to e^{+}e^{-}$ is 4.3%.},

Effectively this shows a fictive enhancement of the cross section at large momentum transfer. However, the enhancement is different for transverse and longitudinal polarizations of the recoil proton. The former is responsible for a deformation of results when extracting the proton electromagnetic form factors ratio from the data on electron-proton polarization transfer scattering. Nevertheless, this effect does not explain the suppression of the Dirac form factor at large momentum transfer completely.},

Next, by using the treediagram approximation of the amplitude, those form factors are calculated explicitly and for the special process $\br{\bar p p} \to \pi^0 \gamma^* \to \pi^0 l^+ l^-$ they are shown to be completely described by the magnetic form factor of the proton in the unphysical region.

  Abstract                 = {The precise quark mass dependence of the one-loop effective action in an instanton background has recently been computed [arXiv:hep-th/0410190]. The result interpolates smoothly between the previously known extreme small and large mass limits. The computational method makes use of the fact that the single instanton background has radial symmetry, so that the computation can be reduced to a sum over partial waves of logarithms of radial determinants, each of which can be computed numerically in an efficient manner. The bare sum over partial waves is divergent and must be regulated and renormalized. In this paper we provide more details of this computation, including both the renormalization procedure and the numerical approach. We conclude with comparisons of our precise numerical results with a simple interpolating function that connects the small and large mass limits, and with the leading order of the derivative expansion.},

This determination is less sensitive to isospin-breaking effects than previous attempts.},

This lagrangian contains the gauged Wess-Zumino term as well as higher order derivative terms of the Skyrme type, the coefficients of which agree with recent phenomenological estimates. In particular, the value predicted for the strength of the standard fourth-order Skyrme term is in satisfactory agreement with the results obtained by fitting the nucleon and delta masses. Our effective chiral lagrangian reproduces the wealth of the results of successful phenomenological lagrangians as, e.g. soft-pion theorems, Goldberger-Treiman relations, PCAC, the KSFR relation, the (approximate) Weinberg relation, etc. Moreover, the predicted mass spectra and decay constants of composite mesons are in qualitative agreement with the experimental findings. Furthermore, when electroweak interactions are included the lagrangian contains vector (axial-vector) dominance based on field-current identities.},

In the first case mesons are treated as composite quark-antiquark objects, whereas in the second case they are introduced as chiral phase of quark fields and external sources in the QCD Lagrangian. Our main attention is devoted to a discussion of the more dynamical first approach. This includes the hadronization of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and various physical applications of the resulting effective Lagrangian concerning strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions of mesons. There emerge basically two principally different types of effective hadron theories reflecting the alternative (but at the same time dual) pictures of baryons: baryons as chiral (topological) solitons of the meson fields and as bound states of quarks and diquarks. It is demonstrated that these two pictures describe only two sides of the same medal.},

The initial $\bar pp$ scattering wave functions originate from a recent $\bar N N$ model. The transition operator is obtained from a combination of the $^3P_0$ and $^3S_1$ quark-antiquark annihilation mechanisms. A good fit to the data, in particular the reproduction of the double dip structure observed in the analyzing powers, requires quark wave functions for proton, antiproton, and pions with radii slightly larger than the respective measured charge radii. This corresponds to an increase in range of the annihilation mechanisms and consequently the amplitudes for total angular momentum J=2 and higher are much larger than in previous approaches. The final state $\pi\pi$ wave functions, parameterized in terms of $\pi\pi$ phase shifts and inelasticities, are also a very important ingredient for the fine tuning of the fit to the observables.},

  Abstract                 = {In the collinear factorization of the form factor for the transition $\gamma^* \pi^0 \to \gamma$ the hard part contains double log terms as $\ln^2 x$ with $x$ as the momentum fraction of partons from 0 to 1. A simple exponentiation for resummation leads to divergent results. We study the resummation of these $\ln^2 x$ terms. We show that the $\ln^2 x$ terms come partly from the light-cone wave function(LCWF) and partly from the form factor. We introduce a jet factor to factorize the $\ln^2 x$ term in the form factor. To handel the $\ln^2 x$ terms from the LCWF we introduce a nonstandard light-cone wave function(NLCWF) with the gauge links off the light-cone direction. An interesting relation between two wave function is found. With the introduced NLCWF and the jet factor we can re-factorize the form factor and obtain a new hard part which does not contain terms with $\ln^2 x$. Beside the renormalization scale $\mu$ the introduce NLCWF and jet factor have extra scales to characterize their $x$-behaviors. Using the evolutions of the extra scales and the relation we can do the resummation perturbatively in sense that the LCWF is the only nonpertubative object in the resumed formula. Our results with some models of LCWF show that there is a significant difference between numerical predictions with the resummation and that without the resummation, and the resummed predictions can describe the experimental data.},

The model incorporates a new theoretical treatment of spin-3/2 resonances, first introduced by Pascalutsa, avoiding pathologies present in previous models. Other main features of the model are chiral symmetry, gauge invariance, and crossing symmetry. We use the model combined with modern optimization techniques to assess the parameters of the nucleon resonances on the basis of world data on electromagnetic multipoles. We present results for electromagnetic multipoles, differential cross sections, asymmetries, and total cross sections for all one pion photoproduction processes on free nucleons. We find overall agreement with data from threshold up to 1 GeV in laboratory frame.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of the behavior of positrons and electrons in given external potentials, neglecting their mutual interaction, is analyzed by replacing the theory of holes by a reinterpretation of the solutions of the Dirac equation. It is possible to write down a complete solution of the problem in terms of boundary conditions on the wave function, and this solution contains automatically all the possibilities of virtual (and real) pair formation and annihilation together with the ordinary scattering processes, including the correct relative signs of the various terms.
In this solution, the "negative energy states" appear in a form which may be pictured (as by St\"uckelberg) in space-time as waves traveling away from the external potential backwards in time. Experimentally, such a wave corresponds to a positron approaching the potential and annihilating the electron. A particle moving forward in time (electron) in a potential may be scattered forward in time (ordinary scattering) or backward (pair annihilation). When moving backward (positron) it may be scattered backward in time (positron scattering) or forward (pair production). For such a particle the amplitude for transition from an initial to a final state is analyzed to any order in the potential by considering it to undergo a sequence of such scatterings.
The amplitude for a process involving many such particles is the product of the transition amplitudes for each particle. The exclusion principle requires that antisymmetric combinations of amplitudes be chosen for those complete processes which differ only by exchange of particles. It seems that a consistent interpretation is only possible if the exclusion principle is adopted. The exclusion principle need not be taken into account in intermediate states. Vacuum problems do not arise for charges which do not interact with one another, but these are analyzed nevertheless in anticipation of application to quantum electrodynamics.
The results are also expressed in momentum-energy variables. Equivalence to the second quantization theory of holes is proved in an appendix.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper two things are done. (1) It is shown that a considerable simplification can be attained in writing down matrix elements for complex processes in electrodynamics. Further, a physical point of view is available which permits them to be written down directly for any specific problem. Being simply a restatement of conventional electrodynamics, however, the matrix elements diverge for complex processes. (2) Electrodynamics is modified by altering the interaction of electrons at short distances. All matrix elements are now finite, with the exception of those relating to problems of vacuum polarization. The latter are evaluated in a manner suggested by Pauli and Bethe, which gives finite results for these matrices also. The only effects sensitive to the modification are changes in mass and charge of the electrons. Such changes could not be directly observed. Phenomena directly observable, are insensitive to the details of the modification used (except at extreme energies). For such phenomena, a limit can be taken as the range of the modification goes to zero. The results then agree with those of Schwinger. A complete, unambiguous, and presumably consistent, method is therefore available for the calculation of all processes involving electrons and photons.
The simplification in writing the expressions results from an emphasis on the over-all space-time view resulting from a study of the solution of the equations of electrodynamics. The relation of this to the more conventional Hamiltonian point of view is discussed. It would be very difficult to make the modification which is proposed if one insisted on having the equations in Hamiltonian form.
The methods apply as well to charges obeying the Klein-Gordon equation, and to the various meson theories of nuclear forces. Illustrative examples are given. Although a modification like that used in electrodynamics can make all matrices finite for all of the meson theories, for some of the theories it is no longer true that all directly observable phenomena are insensitive to the details of the modification used.
The actual evaluation of integrals appearing in the matrix elements may be facilitated, in the simpler cases, by methods described in the appendix.},

Playing an important role in the new representation are new operators for position and spin of the particle which are physically distinct from these operators in the conventional representation. The components of the time derivative of the new position operator all commute and have for eigenvalues all values between -c and c. The new spin operator is a constant of the motion unlike the spin operator in the conventional representation. By a comparison of the new Hamiltonian with the non-relativistic Pauli-Hamiltonian for particles of spin $1/2$, one finds that it is these new operators rather than the conventional ones which pass over into the position and spin operators in the Pauli theory in the non-relativistic limit. The transformation of the new representation is also made in the case of interaction of the particle with an external electromagnetic field. In this way the proper non-relativistic Hamiltonian (essentially the Pauli-Hamiltonian) is obtained in the non-relativistic limit. The same methods may be applied to a Dirac particle interacting with any type of external field (various meson fields, for example) and this allows one to find the proper non-relativistic Hamiltonian in each such case. Some light is cast on the question of why a Dirac electron shows some properties characteristic of a particle of finite extension by an examination of the relationship between the new and the conventional position operators.},

  Abstract                 = {The ratio of the squares of the electric and magnetic proton form factors is shown to be proportional to the ratio of the cross sections for the elastic scattering of an unpolarized electron on a partially polarized proton with and without proton spin flip. The initial proton at rest should be polarized along the direction of the motion of the final proton. Similar results are valid for both radiative $ep$ scattering and the photoproduction of pairs on a proton in the Bethe--Heitler kinematics. When the initial proton is fully polarized in the direction of the motion of the final proton, the cross section for the $ep \to ep$ process, as well as for the $ep \to ep \gamma$ and $\gamma p \to e \bar e p$ processes, without (with) proton spin flip is expressed only in terms of the square of the electric (magnetic) proton form factor. Such an experiment on the measurement of the cross sections without and with proton spin flip would make it possible to acquire new independent data on the behavior of $G_E^2(Q^2)$ and $G_M^2(Q^2)$, which are necessary for resolving the contradictions appearing after the experiment of the JLab collaboration on the measurement of the proton form factors with the method of polarization transfer from the initial electron to the final proton.},

For this purpose, in the case of the hard scattering mechanism we calculated (in the leading approximation) the matrix elements of the proton current J^{\pm \delta,\delta}_p for the full set of spin combinations corresponding to the number of the spin-flipped quarks, which contribute to the proton transition without spin-flip (J^{\delta,\delta}_p) and with the spin-flip (J^{-\delta,\delta}_p). This set is: (0,1), (0,3), (2,1), (2,3), where the first number in parentheses is the number of the spin-flipped quarks, which contribute to the J^{\delta,\delta}_p, and the second one is the number of the spin-flipped quarks which contribute to the J^{-\delta,\delta}_p. For the sets of (0,1) and (2,3), we found that the ratio G_E/G_M ~ 1, and the form factors G_E and G_M behave for the set of (0,1) as G_E, G_M ~ 1/Q^6, and for the set of (2,3) as G_E, G_M ~ 1/Q^4. At the same time the set of (0,1) is realized for \tau << 1, and the set (2,3) for \tau >> 1 (\tau=Q^2/4m^2). This allows us to suppose that: 1) at the lower boundary of the experimental measurements of the ratio G_E/G_M not dipole dependence appears but the law of G_E, G_M ~ 1/Q^6/ 2) the conditions for the observation of the dipole dependence in the experiments has not yet been achieved/ 3) since for quarks J^{\delta,\delta}_q ~ 1 and J^{-\delta,\delta}_q ~ \sqrt{\tau}, then the dipole dependence is realized when \tau >> 1 in the case when the quark transitions with spin-flip are dominate.},

We study the nature of the ``Landau singularities'' in the complex Q^2 plane and show that perturbative freezing can lead, in certain cases, to an analyticity structure that is consistent with causality. We analyze the Analytic Perturbation Theory (APT) approach which is intended to remove the ``Landau singularities'', and show that at 2-loops it is uniquely defined in terms of the Lambert W function, and that, depending on the value of the first two beta function coefficients beta_0 and beta_1, it is either consistent with perturbative freezing (for beta_1 < -beta_0^2) with an infrared limit of -beta_0/beta_1 or leads to a non-perturbative infrared coupling with a limit of 1/beta_0 (for beta_1 > -beta_0^2). The possibility of a causal perturbative coupling is in accordance with the idea that a purely perturbative Banks-Zaks phase with an infrared fixed-point exists in QCD if the number of flavours (N_f) is increased. The causality condition implies that the perturbative phase is realized for N_f \geq 10.},

The ratio of the form factors is directly proportional to the ratio of the transverse to longitudinal components of the polarization of the recoil proton in the elastic ep->ep reaction. The new data presented span the range 3.5<Q2<5.6GeV2 and are well described by a linear Q2 fit. Also, the ratio sqrt{Q2}F2p/F1p reaches a constant value above Q2 = 2GeV2.},

In some specific cases the positive $\alpha$-condition for singularity is shown to be equivalent to the requirement that the discontinuity round each threshold be given by a Cutkosky integral with a "flat" integration counter. This "flatness" requirement, the meaning of which is explained in the paper, implies a correspondence between distortions of extended unitarity integrals and the singularity of anomalous thresholds. In the simplest cases the proof of its equivalence to the positive $\alpha$-condition is direct, but in a more complicated case a delicate cancellation between distortion terms from different extended unitarity integrals has to be proved to establish the result.},

In this case, hadronic part of the two-photon exchange amplitude describes real Compton scattering (RCS). We show that in the case of the beam normal spin asymmetry, this approximation selects only the photon helicity flip amplitudes of RCS. At low energies, we make use of unitarity and estimate the contribution of the $\pi N$ multipoles to the photon helicity flip amplitudes. In the Regge regime, QRCS approximation allows for a contribution from two pion exchange, and we provide an estimate of such contributions. We furthermore discuss the possibility of the quark and gluon GPD's contributions in the QRCS kinematics.},

The properties of the corresponding 18 invariant amplitudes are studied in detail. We consider the special case of elastic VVCS with the virtualities of the initial and final photons equal. The invariant basis for VVCS in this orthogonal form does not exist in the literatur. We furthermore use this VVCS tensor for a calculation of the beam normal spin asymmetry in the forward kinematics. For this, we relate the invariant amplitudes to the helicity amplitudes of the VVCS reaction. The imaginary parts of these latter are related to the inclusive cross section by means of the optical theorem. We use the phenomenological value of the transverse cross section $\sigma_T\sim0.1$ mbarn and the Callan-Gross relation which relates the longitudinal cross section $\sigma_L$ to the transverse one. The result of the calculation agrees with an existing calculation and predicts the negative values of the asymmetry $B_n$ of the order of 4-6 ppm in the energy range from 6 to 45 ppm and for very forward angles.},

  Abstract                 = {We give explicit formulas for the two-body decays of the neutralinos and charginos of the minimal model of supersymmetry. There are two possible classes of two-body final states: (i) neutralino or chargino plus a W, Z, or Higgs boson; and (ii) channels involving squarks or sleptons. The important features of these decays are illustrated and their phenomenological implications discussed. The two-body decay into the lightest Higgs boson is almost always present, and enhances the heavy-quark component of the final state. In addition, two-body-decay branching ratios into a W or Z can be large for the heaviest charginos and neutralinos.},

We then describe how the most general superpotential allowed by E6 leads to constraints upon and relations among the various Higgs-boson masses, and between the Higgs-boson spectrum, the Z', and the masses of supersymmetric particles. In addition we explore the couplings of the Higgs boson to the gauge and other particles of the theory and emphasize the associated implications for Higgs-boson and supersymmetric-particle detection. The tightly constrained nature of the parameter space of the theory leads to very specific predictions.},

We carefully combine a wide variety of data for the e^+e^- production of hadrons, and obtain the optimum form of R(s) = sigma_had^0(s)/sigma_pt(s), together with its uncertainty. Our results for the hadronic contributions to g-2 of the muon are a_mu^(had, LO) = (692.4 +- 5.9_exp +- 2.4_rad) * 10^(-10) and a_mu^(had, NLO) = (-9.8 +- 0.1_exp +- 0.0_rad) * 10^(-10), and for the QED coupling Delta alpha^(5)_had (M_Z^2)= (275.5 +- 1.9_exp +- 1.3_rad) * 10^(-4). These yield (g-2)/2 = 0.00116591763(74), which is about 2.4 sigma below the present world average measurement, and alpha(M_Z^2)^(-1) = 128.954 +- 0.031.

When the symmetry group of the Lagrangian is extended from global to local $U(1)$ transformations by the introduction of coupling with a vector gauge field, the Goldstone boson becomes the longitudinal state of a massive vector boson whose transverse states are the quanta of the transverse gauge field. A perturbative treatment of the model is developed in which the major features of these phenomena are present in zero order. Transition amplitudes for decay and scattering processes are evaluated in lowest order, and it is shown that they may be obtained more directly from an equivalent Lagrangian in which the original symmetry is no longer manifest. When the system is coupled to other systems in a $U(1)$ invariant Lagrangian, the other systems display an induced symmetry breakdown, associated with a partially conserved current which interacts with itself via the massive vector boson.},

Light scalar resonances which are seen in pi pi, pi eta, K K-bar channels of phi(1020) radiative decays and in J/psi decays are responsible for key questions of low-energy dynamics in the strong interaction sector, and decays phi(1020) -> gamma a0(980), phi(1020) -> gamma f0(980), a0(980) -> gamma gamma, f0(980) -> gamma gamma are of interest for current experimental programs in Juelich, Frascati and Novosibirsk. From theoretical point of view it is important to verify whether light scalar mesons are members of some flavor octet or nonet. We find a value of mixing angle dictated by consistency with experiment and coupling structures of ChPT Lagrangian. Decay widths f0(980)/a0(980) -> gamma rho(770)/omega(782), which are not studied experimentally yet, are predicted. We also obtain several relations between widths, which hold independently of coupling constants and represent a fingerprint of the model.},

We also formulate a challenge of constructing non-Markovian MC algorithm for the evolution equations for the initial state QCD radiation with tagging the type and x of the exiting parton.

For elastic $\vec e p \to e \vec p$, GEp/GMp is proportional to $P_t/P_l$. Simultaneous measurement of $P_t$ and $P_l$ in a polarimeter provides good control of the systematic uncertainty. The results for the ratio GEp/GMp show a systematic decrease as Q2 increases from 0.5 to 3.5GeV2, indicating for the first time a definite difference in the spatial distribution of charge and magnetization currents in the proton.},

Our consideration is based on the CCFM-evolved unintegrated gluon densities in a proton. The performed analysis covers the total and differential cross sections of open charm and beauty quarks, $B$ and $D$ mesons (or rather muons from their semileptonic decays) and the total and differential cross sections of $b \bar b$ di-jet hadroproduction. We study the theoretical uncertainties of our calculations and investigate the effects coming from parton showers in initial and final states. Our predictions are compared with the recent experimental data taken by the D0 and CDF collaborations. Special attention is put on the specific angular correlations between the final-state particles. We demonstrate that the final state parton shower plays a crucial role in the description of such observables. The decorrelated part of angular separations can be fully described, if the process $gg^*\rightarrow gg$ is included.},

The main part of the review is devoted to the Regge poles in QCD. The method of the Wilson-loop path integral is used to calculate trajectories of Regge poles for $q-\bar q$ and gluonic states. The problem of the Pomeron in QCD is discussed in details. It is shown how to use the 1/N-expansion for classification of reggeon diagrams in QCD. The role of Regge cuts in reggeon theory is discussed and their importance for high-energy phenomenology is emphasized. Models based on the reggeon calculus, 1/N-expansion in QCD and string picture of interactions at large distances are reviewed and are applied to a broad class of phenomena in strong interactions. It is shown how to apply the reggeon approach to small-x physics in deep inelastic scattering.},

In particular, we study the wellknown (pure hadronic) $\omega \to 3 \pi$ and (radiative) $\omega \to \pi^0 \gamma$ processes, and find good agreement with experiment, comparable to that for any of the current-algebra "theorems." The construction of the Lagrangian is seen to involve subtle theoretical issues. We are led to examine in more detail Witten's "trial-and-error" gauging of the Wess-Zumino term and note that the Bardeen form of the anomaly seems more suitable than the left-right-symmetric form for constructing an effective model with phenomenological spin-1 fields.},

The analysis of the PT series for $C_{Bj}(\alpha_s)$ gives a hint to its asymptotic nature manifesting itself in the region $Q<1~\GeV$. It relates to the observation that the accuracy of both the three- and four-loop PT predictions happens to be at the same 10\% level. On the other hand, the usage of the two-loop APT allows one to describe the precise low energy JLab data down to $Q\sim 300~\MeV$ and gives a possibility for reliable extraction of the higher twist (HT) corrections. At the same time, above $Q\sim700~\MeV$ the APT two-loop order with HT is equivalent to the four-loop PT with HT compatible to zero and is adequate to current accuracy of the data.},

We argue that sufficiently large magnetic fields are created in heavy ion collisions so that the Chiral Magnetic Effect causes preferential emission of charged particles along the direction of angular momentum. Since separation of charge is CP-odd, any observation of the Chiral Magnetic Effect could provide a clear demonstration of the topological nature of the QCD vacuum.

We find that the major uncertainty is in the prediction for the survival probability associated with soft rescattering. We show that an analogous process, the double diffractive production of a pair of jets with large values of $E_T$, has an event rate which makes it accessible at the Tevatron. Observation of this process can therefore be used as a luminosity monitor for two- gluon exchange processes, such as the production of a Higgs boson with rapidity gaps on either side.},

We present analytical expressions for the cross section through next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N^4LO) and next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. Special attention is paid to the role of subleading logarithms and how they relate to the convergence of the perturbation series and differences between various resummation prescriptions. It is shown that care must be taken to avoid unphysical terms in the expansions. Numerical results are presented for top quark production at the Tevatron. We find sizeable increases to the total cross section and differential distributions and a dramatic reduction of the factorization scale dependence relative to next-to-leading order.},

A three-parameter formula for the decay-electron distribution is obtained as a generalization of the Michel formula for an unpolarized muon. This general formula is examined to determine to what extent the observed spectrum enables one to decide whether any particular theory is correct or not. It is seen, among other things, that by the observation of the muon decay spectrum alone one cannot test the validity of the two-component neutrino theory. To facilitate a possible accurate experimental test of the two-component neutrino theory, the radiative correction for the decay of a polarized muon is worked out to the lowest order in $alpha$. Although the correction is rather complicated, it can still be expressed approximately by the three-parameter formula mentioned above. It is found, in particular, that the corrected Michel parameter for the two-component theory is 0.706 when a neutrino and an antineutrino are emitted in the final state, which is 6% smaller than the value 0.75 predicted by the simple theory.},

We find the main contribution to inclusive b-jet production to be the scattering of a Reggeized gluon and a Reggeized b-quark to a b quark, which is described by the effective Reggeon-Reggeon-quark vertex. The main contribution to b anti-b-pair production arises from the scattering of two Reggeized gluons to a b anti-b pair, which is described by the effective Reggeon-Reggeon-quark-quark vertex. Our anaysis is based on the Kimber-Martin-Ryskin prescription for unintegrated gluon and quark distribution functions using as input the Martin-Roberts-Stirling-Thorne collinear parton distribution functions of the proton.},

Such simple quark models describe basic features of the $p \bar p \to \pi^+\pi^-$ reaction, but fail to reproduce details of the $p \bar p \to K^+K^-$ angular distributions. Possible improvements are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a new reformulation of Yang-Mills theory in which three- and four-gluon self-interactions are eliminated at the price of introducing a sufficient number of auxiliary fields. We discuss the validity of this reformulation in the possible applications such as dynamical gluon mass generation, color confinement and glueball mass calculation. Moreover, we set up a new $1/N_c$ color expansion in the $SU(N_c)$ Yang-Mills theory based on this reformulation. In fact, we give the Feynman rules of the $1/N_c$ expansion in the manifestly Lorentz covariant gauge. The Yang-Mills theory is defined on a non-trivial vacuum where color--singlet transverse gluon pair condensations take place by the attractive gluonic self-interactions. This vacuum condensation provides a common non-vanishing mass for all the gluons with color symmetry being preserved. It is shown that the auxiliary fields become dynamical by acquiring the kinetic term due to quantum corrections. Then the static potential between a pair of color charges is derived as a combination of the Yukawa-type potential and the linear potential with non-vanishing string tension. The mass of the lightest scalar glueball is calculated as the ratio to the gluon mass. The explicit calculations are performed as a partial resummation of the leading order diagrams for the small 't Hooft coupling.},

Such measurements significantly enhance the analysis of precision data on the $Z_0$ resonance, permitting tests of the running of the electroweak coupling constants. The behavior of the coupling constants as a function of $Q^2$ can reveal the presence of many possible new physics scenarios, such as new gauge bosons, superparticles and substructure; some of these effects are difficult to observe on the $Z_0$ pole. In order to probe energy scales up to $1~\TeV$, future low $Q^2$ measurements must be precise enough to measure electroweak radiative corrections. Two experimental programs which aim to reach this sensitivity are deep inelastic neutrino nucleon scattering and atomic parity violation experiments. Another important technique is polarized electron scattering off unpolarized targets. We review the current status and future prospects of such measurements. We present an experimental design to measure the left-right parity violating asymmetry in polarized M{\o}ller scattering ($e^-e^- \to e^-e^-$), which could constitute the most precise measurement of the weak mixing angle $\sin^2\hat\theta_W\br{M_Z^2}$ at $Q^2 \ll M_Z^2$.},

  Abstract                 = {The transverse beam spin induced asymmetry is calculated for the scattering of transversally polarized electrons on a proton target within a realistic model. Such asymmetry is due to the interference between the Born amplitude and the imaginary part of two photon exchange amplitude. In particular, the contribution of non-excited hadron state (elastic) to the two photon amplitude is calculated. The elastic contribution requires infrared divergences regularization and can be expressed in terms of numerical integrals of the target form factor. The inelastic channel corresponding to the one pion hadronic state contribution is enhanced by squared logarithmic terms. We show that the ratio of elastic over inelastic channel is of the order of 0.3 and cannot be ignored. Enhancement effects due to the decreasing of form factors bring the transverse beam asymmetry to values as large as $10^{-4}$ for particular kinematical conditions.},

To provide the convergence of these integrals we construct differences of individual sum rules for different hadrons. Universal interaction of Pomeron with nucleons is assumed. We derive the explicit formulae for processes of electro-production on proton and light isobar nuclei. Sudakov's parametrization of momenta, for peripheral kinematics relevant here, is used.

A sum rule is built, based on arguments from analyticity. It relates the differential cross section of elastic electron-proton scattering including form factors, and the cross section of inelastic scattering channel, with a contribution of nucleon anti-nucleon pair production arising from the Fermi statistics. The last term is calculated in frame of a simple model of nucleon-pion interaction.},

Inelastic intermediate hadronic states (different from one-proton state) of the two photon exchange amplitude give rise to contributions containing the square of "large logarithm" (logarithm of the ratio of the transferred momentum to the electron mass). We investigate the presence of such contributions in higher orders of perturbation theory. The relation with the case of zero transfer momentum is explicitly given.

The asymmetry dependence on the center of mass energy in the range near the resonance is presented. The comparison with a similar effect in these reactions with the neutral $Z$-boson in the intermediate state is given. We show that these effects are $\le 10^{-3}$.

  Abstract                 = {We present a phenomenological discussion of spin-independent, generalized dipole polarizabilities of hadrons entering the virtual Compton scattering process gamma* h -> gamma h. We introduce a new method of obtaining a tensor basis with appropriate Lorentz-invariant amplitudes which are free from kinematical singularities and constraints. We then motivate a gauge-invariant separation into a generalized Born term containing ground-state properties only, and a residual contribution describing the model-dependent internal structure. The generalized dipole polarizabilities are defined in terms of Lorentz-invariant residual amplitudes. Particular emphasis is laid on a physical interpretation of these quantities as characterizing the spatial distributions of the induced electric polarization and magnetization of hadrons. It is argued that three dipole polarizabilities, namely the longitudinal electric alpha_L(q^2), the transverse electric alpha_T(q^2), and the magnetic beta(q^2) ones are required in order to fully reconstruct local polarizations induced by soft external fields in a hadron. One of these polarizabilities, alpha_T(q^2), describes an effect of higher order in the soft final-photon momentum q'. We argue that the associated spatial distributions obtained via the Fourier transforms in the Breit frame are meaningful even for such a light particle as the pion. The spatial distributions are determined at large distances r ~ 1/m_pi for pions, kaons, and octet baryons by use of ChPT.},

The limit of an infinitely large mass of the Higgs field at a finite density of the BPS monopole is considered as a model of the stable vacuum in the pure Yang-Mills theory. It is shown that, in QCD, such a monopole vacuum may lead to a rising potential, a topological confinement and an additional mass of the $\eta_0$ meson. The relationship between the result obtained here for the generating functional of perturbation theory and Faddeev-Popov integral is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a very large body of literature in which the Nambu-Jona-Lasino (NJL) model has been applied in the study of mesons, baryons, and hadronic matter. One area of interest has been the calculation of corrections of order 1/Nc to various quantities calculated in the leading (Hartree) approximation. Of particular interest is the work of Dmitra\v{s}inovi\'{c}, Schulze, Tegen, and Lemmer [Ann. Phys. (N.Y.) 238, 332 (1995)]. These authors have considered the SU(2)-flavor NJL model and identified a set of diagrams, whose calculation yields 1/Nc corrections, while at the same time maintaining the relations, such as the Goldberger-Treiman relation, that follow from the chiral symmetry of the theory. In the present work we extend the work of Dmitra\v{s}inovi\'{c} et al. to the case of SU(3)-flavor symmetry. In particular, we consider 1/Nc corrections to the quark vacuum condensates and to the ``gap equation.'' While 1/Nc corrections to the pion decay constant are significant, the corrections to the condensates are found to be quite small, as was the case in the SU(2)-flavor analysis. The Pauli-Villars regularization procedure is thought to be particularly useful for such calculations, since that procedure is known to maintain the symmetries of the theory. As part of our analysis we extend the Pauli-Villars regularization procedure to the case in which a particular diagram contains quarks of different constituent mass. Such diagrams appear when we generalize the SU(2)-flavor analysis to SU(3). We also show that, if we use the ``textbook'' definition of the Pauli-Villars method, in which fictitious particles of large mass are added to the theory, the resulting formalism may not be used in the case of the NJL model. What is done in practice is that particular divergent (and nondivergent) integrals are regulated in a fashion that yields results that are quite similar to the results of the covariant regularization procedure that is used by many authors. For constituent quark mass values of the magnitude usually used in the case of the SU(3)-flavor NJL model, we find that the 1/Nc corrections in the calculation of the pion decay constant play a role in obtaining satisfactory values for the quark vacuum condensates and the strength of the 't Hooft interaction.},

These seemingly contradictory observations can be reconciled in the k_T factorization theorem: the increase of the measured Q^2F_{pi gamma}(Q^2) for Q^2 > 10 GeV^2 is explained by convoluting a k_T dependent hard kernel with a flat pion distribution amplitude, k_T being a parton transverse momentum. The low Q^2 data are accommodated by including the resummation of alpha_s ln^2x, x being a parton momentum fraction, which provides a stronger suppression at the endpoints of x. The next-to-leading-order correction to the pion transition form factor is found to be less than 20% in the considered range of Q^2.},

We investigate the total and differential cross sections of bbH and ttH production taking into account also the non-negligible contribution from the q + q -> Q + Q + H mechanism. In the numerical calculations we use the unintegrated gluon distributions obtained from the CCFM evolution equation. Our results are compared with the leading and next-to-leading order predictions of the collinear factorization of QCD.},

We calculate the transverse momentum distributions and study the Higgs-jet and jet-jet azimuthal correlations in the Higgs + one or two jet production processes.

This reproduction of the NN data is more accurate than by any phase-shift analysis and any other NN potential. The charge-dependence of the present potential (that has been dubbed `CD-Bonn') is based upon the predictions by the Bonn Full Model for charge-symmetry and charge-independence breaking in all partial waves with J <= 4. The potential is represented in terms of the covariant Feynman amplitudes for one-boson exchange which are nonlocal. Therefore, the off-shell behavior of the CD-Bonn potential differs in a characteristic and well-founded way from commonly used local potentials and leads to larger binding energies in nuclear few- and many-body systems, where underbinding is a persistent problem.},

The decays $\tau^\to(K \pi)^-\nu$, $(K \pi\pi)^-\nu$ and $(K \pi\pi\pi)^-\nu$ with final states consisting of neutral and charged kaons and pions, have been studied. The invariant mass distribution of 93.4\% of these final states have been experimentally determined.

The reconstructed strange final states, corrected for resolution effects and detection efficiencies, yield the strange spectral function of the $\tau$ lepton. The moments of the spectral function which are important input parameters for theoretical analyses, are determined. From the CKM weighted difference of strange and nonstrange spectral moments, the mass of the strange quark has been measured to be $m_s(m_\tau^2) = (84 \pm 14_{exp} \pm 6_{V_{us}} \pm 17_{theo})$MeV.

  Abstract                 = {Recently, the QCD renormalization group (RG) equation at higher orders in MS-like renormalization schemes has been solved for the running coupling as a series expansion in powers of the exact 2-loop order coupling. In this work, we prove that the power series converges to all orders in perturbation theory. Solving the RG equation at higher orders, we determine the running coupling as an implicit function of the 2-loop order running coupling. Then we analyze the singularity structure of the higher order coupling in the complex 2-loop coupling plane. This enables us to calculate the radii of convergence of the series solutions at the 3- and 4-loop orders as a function of the number of quark flavours nf. In parallel, we discuss in some detail the singularity structure of the $\bar MS$ coupling at the 3- and 4-loops in the complex momentum squared plane for $0 \leq n_f \leq 16$. The correspondence between the singularity structure of the running coupling in the complex momentum squared plane and the convergence radius of the series solution is established. For sufficiently large nf values, we find that the series converges for all values of the momentum squared variable $Q^2=-q^2>0$. For lower values of $n_f$, in the $\bar MS$ scheme, we determine the minimal value of the momentum squared Q2min above which the series converges. We study properties of the non-power series corresponding to the presented power series solution in the QCD Analytic Perturbation Theory approach of Shirkov and Solovtsov. The Euclidean and Minkowskian versions of the non-power series are found to be uniformly convergent over whole ranges of the corresponding momentum squared variables.},

  Abstract                 = {The Lambert-W explicit solutions to the QCD renormalization group (RG) equation are considered up to fourth order in the $\bar MS$ scheme. We compare, systematically, these solutions with the conventional asymptotical (iterative) approximations and with the exact numerical solutions to the RG equation in the domain with three quark flavours. Applications of these solutions in analytic perturbation theory (APT) are discussed. Using these (Lambert-W, asymptotical and exact numerical) solutions we reconstruct the expansion functions for the non-power APT series in the space- and time-like regions. These expansion functions are examined in the infrared region. It is shown that the Lambert-W solutions provide the excellent accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {The two-loop invariant (running) coupling of QCD is written in terms of the Lambert W function. The analyticity structure of the coupling in the complex Q^2-plane is established. The corresponding analytic coupling is reconstructed via a dispersion relation. We also consider some other approximations to the QCD beta-function, when the corresponding couplings are solved in terms of the Lambert function. The Landau gauge gluon propagator has been considered in the renormalization group invariant analytic approach (IAA). It is shown that there is a nonperturbative ambiguity in determination of the anomalous dimension function of the gluon field. Several analytic solutions for the propagator at the one-loop order are constructed. Properties of the obtained analytical solutions are discussed.},

The sum rule treatment is a modification of previous analyses necessitated by the observation that those analyses produce forms of the correlator that fail to be dominated, near $q^2=0$, by the most nearby singularities. Inclusion of contributions associated with the $\phi$ meson rectify this problem. The resulting sum rule fit provides evidence for a significant direct $\omega\rightarrow\pi\pi$ coupling contribution in $e^+e^-\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-$. It is also pointed out that results for the $q^2$-dependence of the correlator cannot be used to provide information about the (off-shell) $q^2$-dependence of the off-diagonal element of the vector meson propagator unless a very specific choice of interpolating fields for the vector mesons is made. The results for the value of the correlator near $q^2=0$ in ChPT are shown to be more than an order of magnitude smaller than those extracted from the sum rule analysis and the reasons why this suggests slow convergence of the chiral series for the correlator given.},

We show here that the OPE representations of the longitudinal contributions appearing in these analyses, which are already known to be poorly converging, have in addition an unphysical $k$ dependence which produces a significant unphysical decrease in $m_s$ with increasing $k$. We also show how, using additional sum rule constraints, the decay constants of the excited resonances in the strange scalar and pseudoscalar channels may be determined, allowing one to evaluate the longitudinal spectral contributions to the $(k,0)$ sum rules. Taking into account the very-accurately known $\pi$ and $K$ pole contributions, we find that longitudinal contributions can be determined with an accuracy at the few % level, and hence reliably subtracted, leaving an analysis for $m_s$ involving the sum of longitudinal and transverse contributions, for which the OPE representation is much better converged.},

Our starting point is the gauge-independent, path-dependent formalism which we proposed earlier. The path-dependent Green's functions in this theory are expressed in terms of auxiliary, path-independent Green's functions in such a way that the path-dependence equation is automatically satisfied. The formula relating the path-dependent to the auxiliary Green's functions is similar to the classical formula relating the path-dependent field variables to the potentials. By using a notation similar but not identical to Schwinger's functional notation, the infinite set of equations satisfied by the Green's function can be replaced by a single equation. When the equation for the auxiliary Green's functions of electromagnetism is solved in a perturbation series, the usual Feynman rules result. For the Yang-Mills field, however, one obtains extra terms; such terms correspond precisely to the closed loops of fictitious scalar particles introduced by Feynman, DeWitt, and Faddeev and Popov.},

  Abstract                 = {Independent of assumptions about the form of the quark-quark scattering kernel, K, we derive the explicit relation between the flavour-nonsinglet pseudoscalar meson Bethe-Salpeter amplitude, Gamma_H, and the dressed-quark propagator in the chiral limit. In addition to a term proportional to gamma_5, Gamma_H necessarily contains qualitatively and quantitatively important terms proportional to gamma_5 gamma.P and gamma_5 gamma.k k.P, where P is the total momentum of the bound state. The axial-vector vertex contains a bound state pole described by Gamma_H, whose residue is the leptonic decay constant for the bound state. The pseudoscalar vertex also contains such a bound state pole and, in the chiral limit, the residue of this pole is related to the vacuum quark condensate. The axial-vector Ward-Takahashi identity relates these pole residues; with the Gell-Mann--Oakes-Renner relation a corollary of this identity. The dominant ultraviolet asymptotic behaviour of the scalar functions in the meson Bethe-Salpeter amplitude is fully determined by the behaviour of the chiral limit quark mass function, and is characteristic of the QCD renormalisation group. The rainbow-ladder Ansatz for K, with a simple model for the dressed-quark-quark interaction, is used to illustrate and elucidate these general results. The model preserves the one-loop renormalisation group structure of QCD. The numerical studies also provide a means of exploring procedures for solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation without a three-dimensional reduction.},

For the first time we have measured the cross section for $\gamma\gamma\to\pi^0\pi^0$ for $\pi^0\pi^0$ invariant masses ranging from threshold to about $2 GeV$. We measure an approximately flat cross section of about $10 nb$ for $W=m_{\pi^0\pi^0}<0.8 GeV$, which is below $0.6 GeV$, in good agreement with a theoretical prediction based on an unitarized Born-term model. At higher invariant masses we observe formation of the $f_2(1270)$ resonance and a hint of the $f_0(975)$. We deduce the following two-photon widths: $\Gamma_{\gamma\gamma}(f_2(1270))=3.19\pm0.16\pm0.280.29 keV$ and $\Gamma_{\gamma\gamma}(f_0(975))<0.53 keV$ at 90% C.L. The decay-angular distributions show the $\pi^0\pi^0$ system to be dominantly spin 0 for $W<0.7 GeV$ and spin 2, helicity 2 in the $f_2(1270)$ region, with helicity 0 contributing at most 22% (90% C.L.).},

These parton distributions supersede the previously available "MRST" sets and should be used for the first LHC data-taking and for the associated theoretical calculations. New data sets fitted include CCFR/NuTeV dimuon cross sections, which constrain the strange quark and antiquark distributions, and Tevatron Run II data on inclusive jet production, the lepton charge asymmetry from W decays and the Z rapidity distribution. Uncertainties are propagated from the experimental errors on the fitted data points using a new dynamic procedure for each eigenvector of the covariance matrix. We discuss the major changes compared to previous MRST fits, briefly compare to parton distributions obtained by other fitting groups, and give predictions for the W and Z total cross sections at the Tevatron and LHC.},

We discuss the key dynamical features that need to be accounted for, in particular the fact that the driving force is due to the other monopoles (rather than being due to local curvature as in the case of extended objects) and new forms of energy loss terms due to monopole-antimonopole capture and annihilation. For the case of local monopoles we recover and generalize the results of Preskill, suggesting that the scaling law for the monopole correlation length is very sensitive to the annihilation rate. On the other hand, for global monopoles the long-range forces generically lead to linear scaling (just like in the case of local cosmic strings). In this case we also find good qualitative agreement between our results and the numerical simulations of Bennett & Rhie and Yamaguchi, although future high-resolution simulations will be needed for quantitative comparisons.},

At the level of the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) radiative corrections, only that part of the hard-scattering amplitude is included that is proportional to the beta-function, taking into account the leading zeroth-order harmonic. The relative size of the NNLO contribution in the prediction for the form factor Fgamma*gamma pi(Q2) has been analyzed, making use of the BLM scale-setting procedure. In addition, predictions for the form factor Fgamma*rho pi are obtained that turn out to be sensitive to the endpoint behavior of the pion distribution amplitude, thus providing in connection with experimental data an additional adjudicator for the pion distribution amplitude. In a note added, we comment on the preliminary high-Q2 BaBar data on Fgamma*gamma pi arguing that the significant growth of the form factor between 10 and 40 GeV2 cannot be explained in terms of higher-order perturbative corrections at the NNLO.},

The anomaly is defined by a=(g-2)/2, where the Land\'e g-factor is the proportionality constant that relates the spin to the magnetic moment. For the muon, as well as for the electron and tauon, the anomaly a differs slightly from zero (of order 10^{-3}) because of radiative corrections. In the Standard Model, contributions to the anomaly come from virtual `loops' containing photons and the known massive particles. The relative contribution from heavy particles scales as the square of the lepton mass over the heavy mass, leading to small differences in the anomaly for e, \mu, and \tau. If there are heavy new particles outside the Standard Model which couple to photons and/or leptons, the relative effect on the muon anomaly will be \sim (m_\mu/ m_e)^2 \approx 43\times 10^3 larger compared with the electron anomaly. Because both the theoretical and experimental values of the muon anomaly are determined to high precision, it is an excellent place to search for the effects of new physics, or to constrain speculative extensions to the Standard Model. Details of the current theoretical evaluation, and of the series of experiments that culminates with E821 at the Brookhaven National Laboratory are given. At present the theoretical and the experimental values are known with a similar relative precision of 0.5 ppm. There is, however, a 3.4 standard deviation difference between the two, strongly suggesting the need for continued experimental and theoretical study},

A new matched production algorithm for the processes ggtbH and gbtH is used allowing to span the investigated mass range from mHmt up to mHmt with a consistent treatment of the transition region. For the considered charged Higgs boson masses from 165 to 600 GeV, H is the most relevant decay channel together with Htb . Whereas the latter suffers from large irreducible backgrounds, the decay channel offers a decisively cleaner signature. This is the first \textsc{Atlas} Full Simulation study of the H channel. For the background, \textsc{Atlas} Fast Simulation is used for the investigation of a greater variety of channels than in previous studies, emphasizing the need for new selection cuts with additional discriminating power between signal and background. Such cuts are introduced and it is shown that current limits from direct charged Higgs boson searches can be substantially extended already with a few years of LHC data.},

Despite these restrictions, the limited angular converge of the experiments means that solutions with quite different proportions of $S$ wave and $D$ waves of both helicities 0 and 2 are admitted above $1 GeV$. This leads to a much wider range of possibilities for the couplings of the braod resonances $f_0(\varepsilon)$ and $f_2(1270)$ than is commonly supposed. The better fits have $\Gamma_{f_0}$ in excess of 4 keV and a ratio of greater than 2.},

The result is further improved by using the vector spectral function which must be extrapolated to the chiral limit. This extrapolation is shown to be reliably performed under the constraint of a set of sum rules. The sum rule is employed not as an approximation to $M_{\pi^+}-M_{\pi^0}$ but as an exact result for a chiral low-energy parameter. A sufficiently precise evaluation provides also an estimate for a combination of subleading electromagnetic low-energy parameters.},

The idea can be put into a mathematical formulation utilizing a generalized Hartree-Fock approximation which regards real nucleons as quasi-particle excitations. We consider a simplified model of nonlinear four-fermion interaction which allows a gamma5-gauge group. An interesting consequence of the symmetry is that there arise automatically pseudoscalar zero-mass bound states of nucleon-antinucleon pair which may be regarded as an idealized pion. In addition, massive bound states of nucleon number zero and two are predicted in a simple approximation.
The theory contains two parameters which can be explicitly related to observed nucleon mass and the pion-nucleon coupling constant. Some paradoxical aspects of the theory in connection with the gamma5 transformation are discussed in detail.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the e^{+}e^{-} to phi pi pi reaction for pions in an isoscalar s-wave which is dominated by loop mechanisms. For kaon loops we start from the conventional RCHPT, but use the unitarized amplitude for KbarK-pipi scattering and the full kaon form factor instead of the lowest order terms. We study also effects of vector mesons using RCHPT supplemented with the conventional anomalous term for VVP interactions and taking into account the effects of heavy vector mesons in the K*K transition form factor. We find a peak in the dipion invariant mass around the f_{0}(980) as in the experiment. Selecting the phi f_{0}(980) contribution as a function of the e^{+}e^{-} energy we also reproduce the experimental data except for a narrow peak, yielding support to the existence of a 1^{--} resonance above the phi f_{0}(980) threshold, coupling strongly to this state.},

We show that the only effect of the U_A(1) anomaly in these processes is in the formation of the eta and eta' systems.

  Abstract                 = {We evaluate systematically some new contributions of the QCD scalar mesons, including radiative decay-productions, not considered with a better attention until now in the evaluation of the hadronic contributions to the muon anomaly. The sum of the scalar contributions to be added to the existing Standard Model predictions $a_\mu^{SM}$ are estimated in units $10^{-10}$ to be $a^{S}_\mu= 1.0(0.6)$ [TH based] and $13(11)$ [ PDG based], where the errors are dominated by the ones from the experimental widths of these scalar mesons. PDG based results suggest that the value of $a_\mu^{SM}$ and its errors might have been underestimated in previous works. The inclusion of these new effects leads to a perfect agreement ($< 1.1\sigma$) of the measured value $a^{exp}_\mu$ and $a_\mu^{SM}$ from tau-decay and implies a ($1.5 \sim 3.3$) sigma discrepancy between $a^{exp}_\mu$ and $a_\mu^{SM}$ from $e^+e^-$ into hadrons data. More refined unbiased estimates of $a_\mu^{SM}$ require improved measurements of the scalar meson masses and widths. The impact of our results to $a_\mu^{SM}$ is summarized in the conclusions.},

  Abstract                 = {An approach to deep inelastic scattering is described in which the matrix elements arising from the operator product expansion are factorised into composite operator propagators and proper vertex functions. In the case of polarised $\m p$ scattering, the composite operator propagator is identified with the square root of the QCD topological susceptibility $\sqrt{\chi^{\prime}(0)}$, while the corresponding proper vertex is a renormalisation group invariant. We estimate $\chi^{\prime}(0)$ using QCD spectral sum rules and find that it is significantly suppressed relative to the OZI expectation. Assuming OZI is a good approximation for the proper vertex, our predictions, $\int_{0}^{1}dx g_1^p (x;Q^2=10\GV^2)= 0.143 \pm 0.005$ and $G^{(0)}_A \equiv \Delta \Sigma = 0.353 \pm 0.052$, are in excellent agreement with the new SMC data. This result, together with one confirming the validity of the OZI rule in the $\hp$ radiative decay, supports our earlier conjecture that the suppression in the flavour singlet component of the first moment of $g_1^p$ observed by the EMC-SMC collaboration is a target-independent feature of QCD related to the $U(1)$ anomaly and is not a property of the proton structure. As a corollary, we extract the magnitude of higher twist effects from the neutron and Bjorken sum rules.},

Second, by performing an analysis of the couplings of the scalar mesons to pairs of pseudoscalars and third, by analysing the couplings of the scalars with meson-meson SU(3) scattering eigenstates. Every of the last two methods agree that the mixing angle between the singlet and the octet I=0 states is \theta= 19^o\pm 5 degrees, so that the \sigma is mainly the singlet and the f_0(980) the isosinglet octet state.},

The present work implements in an accurate way the final state interaction of the meson-meson system, which is shown to be essential in order to reproduce the data, particularly the $L = 0$ channel. This latter channel is treated here following a recent theoretical work in which the meson-meson amplitudes are well reproduced and the $f_0$, $a_0$, $\sigma$ resonances show up clearly as poles of the t matrix. The present work, as done in earlier ones, also incorporates elements of chiral symmetry and exchange of vector and axial resonances in the crossed channels, as well as a direct coupling to the $f_2(1270)$ and $a_2(1370)$ resonances. We also evaluate the decay width of the $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ resonances into the $\gamma\gamma$ channel.},

  Abstract                 = {The matrix element for bremsstrahlung and pair production is written in a particularly simple form which reduces to the wellknown matrix element for nonrelativistic energies, in terms of a vector which is closely related to the nonrelativistic current density vector. The cross section for high-energy bremsstrahlung and pair production involving arbitrarily polarized photons and electrons has been calculated. The Coulomb and screening effects are taken into account exactly. It is found that the screening and Coulomb corrections to the polarization-dependent part of the cross section are analytically of the same form and numerically of the same magnitude as the corrections to the polarization-independent part of the cross section found earlier. We also give the cross section for bremsstrahlung summed over spin and polarization directions and integrated over the direction of motion of the final particle, i.e., the angular distribution of the radiation, which has a very simple form. Formulas are given for the linear and circular polarization of bremsstrahlung from arbitrarily polarized electrons and for the spin polarization of pairs from arbitrarily polarized photons. The circular polarization of bremsstrahlung from longitudinally polarized electrons is complete at the upper end of the spectrum and is much larger than from transversely polarized electrons throughout the spectrum. In the same way, circularly polarized photons produce longitudinally polarized electron-positron pairs, the probability of producing transversely polarized pair particles being, in general, much smaller. The faster one of the pair particles is always polarized in the same sense as the photon. On the other hand, the linear polarization of bremsstrahlung is smallest at the upper end of the spectrum and increases with decreasing photon energy. It is independent of the spin of the initial electron if one sums over the spin of the final particle. The circular polarization of the emitted photons is to a high degree independent of screening and Coulomb corrections, at the high energies considered here. The linear polarization is, however, significantly dependent on these corrections. Similar conclusions hold for pair production from circularly and linearly polarized photons, respectively. Finally, the electron spin-photon polarization correlation for bremsstrahlung and pair production is discussed. The depolarization, because of bremsstrahlung, of polarized electrons passing through matter is calculated and is appreciable over a radiation length. It is greater for a transversely polarized electron than for a longitudinally polarized electron.},

Using the gap equation we construct the effective potential, from which the structure of the vacuum can be settled. For some set of parameters the effective potential has several extrema, that in the case of SU(2)_I\times U(1)_Y flavor symmetry can be understood on topological grounds. With increasing strength of the fluctuations the spontaneously broken phase gets unstable and the trivial vacuum is restored. The effective potential reveals furthermore the existence of logarithmic singularities at certain field expectation values, signalizing caustic regions.},

The only departure from QED-like correction can be seen in a region where the lowest-order cross section is lowered by weak-e.m. interference.

  Abstract                 = {After a brief review of the muon g-2 status, we analyze the possibility that the present discrepancy between experiment and the Standard Model (SM) prediction may be due to hypothetical errors in the determination of the hadronic leading-order contribution to the latter. In particular, we show how an increase of the hadro-production cross section in low-energy e^+e^- collisions could bridge the muon g-2 discrepancy, leading however to a decrease on the electroweak upper bound on M_H, the SM Higgs boson mass. That bound is currently M_H < ~ 150GeV (95%CL) based on the preliminary top quark mass M_t = 172.6(1.4)GeV and the recent determination \Delta \alpha_{\rm had}^{(5)}(M_Z) = 0.02768(22), while the direct-search lower bound is M_H > 114.4GeV (95%CL). By means of a detailed analysis we conclude that this solution of the muon g-2 discrepancy is unlikely in view of current experimental error estimates. However, if this turns out to be the solution, the 95%CL upper bound on M_H is reduced to about 130GeV which, in conjunction with the experimental lower bound, leaves a narrow window for the mass of this fundamental particle.},

  Abstract                 = {We obtain reliable $\pi\pi$ scattering amplitudes consistent with experimental data, both at low and high energies, and fulfilling appropriate analyticity properties. We do this by first fitting experimental low energy ($s^{1/2}\leq1.42 {\rm GeV}$) phase shifts and inelasticities with expressions that incorporate analyticity and unitarity. In particular, for the S wave with isospin~0, we discuss in detail several sets of experimental data. This provides low energy partial wave amplitudes that summarize the known experimental information. Then, we impose Regge behaviour as follows from factorization and experimental data for the imaginary parts of the scattering amplitudes at higher energy, and check fulfillment of dispersion relations up to 0.925 GeV. This allows us to improve our fits. The ensuing $\pi\pi$ scattering amplitudes are then shown to verify dispersion relations up to 1.42 GeV, as well as $s - t - u$ crossing sum rules and other consistency conditions. The improved parametrizations therefore provide a reliable representation of pion-pion amplitudes with which one can test chiral perturbation theory calculations, pionium decays, or use as input for CP-violating $K$ decays. In this respect, we find $[a_0^{(0)}-a_0^{(2)}]^2=(0.077\pm0.008) M^{-1}_\pi$ and $\delta_0^{(0)}(m^2_K)-\delta_0^{(2)}(m^2_K)=52.9\pm1.6^{\rm o}$.},

For three decades Jaffe has argued for a tetraquark composition, while others have claimed it is largely a glueball. A key pointer to its nature is its coupling to two photons. Consequently, there have been recent proposals to observe this important scalar hiding in $\gamma\gamma\to\pi^0\pi^0$. We show here that the $\sigma$ is already crouching in this cross section exactly as measured 20 years ago. What is new is that precise knowledge of the position of the $\sigma$ pole, provided by the analysis of the Roy equations,now allows its two photon coupling to be accurately fixed. Its two photon width is found to be $(4.1 \pm 0.3) keV$, a value far too large for a wholly gluonic, or even a tetraquark, state.},

  Abstract                 = {The discovery of asymptotic freedom has opened up the possibility of extracting new sorts of detailed, dynamical consequences from a strongly interacting quantum field theory. The necessary tools - perturbation theory, the renormalization group, gauge theories, and the operator product expansion - are not new. To anyone familiar with these field theoretic approaches to strong interactions, the novel feature is a simple fact: there is a unique class of theories in which вЂњthe origin is an ultraviolet fixed pointвЂќ. But the consequences are so exciting that it seemed appropriate to review these ideas as they reflect on each other. Many important applications of the renormalization group and the operator product expansion to hadronic physics are omitted; the emphasis here is on recent work based on asymptotically free field theories. No doubt, there are some developments so recent that they are not treated in this article.
The discussion of the basic results concerning short distance behavior is informal, but, hopefully, accurate and complete. The specific applications are treated in varying detail.},

Such pion DA can be obtained in the effective chiral quark model. The possible flat shape of the pion DA implies that the standard expansion of the DA in Gegenbauer polynomials can be divergent. On basis of chiral models we predict that the two-pion DA should exhibit anomalous endpoint behaviour for pions in the S-wave and that such feature is absent for higher partial waves. The latter implies that the rho, f 2, etc. meson DAs have no anomalous endpoint behaviour. Possible implications of such pion DA for other hard exclusive processes are shortly discussed.},

Since we can compute also the k_T^2 dependence of the light cone wave functions, we calculate k_T^2 moments of the pseudo-scalar and axial-vector wave functions which are related to the mixed vacuum condensates.

  Abstract                 = {Precise measurements of the proton electromagnetic form factor ratio $R=\mu_pG^p_E/G^p_M$ using the polarization transfer method at Jefferson Lab have revolutionized the understanding of nucleon structure by revealing the strong decrease of $R$ with momentum transfer $Q^2$ for $Q^2 \geq 1~\GeV^2$, in strong disagreement with previous extractions of $R$ from cross section measurements. In particular, the polarization transfer results have exposed the limits of applicability of the one-photon-exchange approximation and highlighted the role of quark orbital angular momentum in the nucleon structure. The GEp-II experiment in Jefferson Lab's Hall A measured $R$ at four $Q^2$ values in the range $3.5~\GeV^2 \leq Q^2 \leq 5.6~\GeV^2$. A possible discrepancy between the originally published GEp-II results and more recent measurements at higher $Q^2$ motivated a new analysis of the GEp-II data. This article presents the final results of the GEp-II experiment, including details of the new analysis, an expanded description of the apparatus and an overview of theoretical progress since the original publication. The key result of the final analysis is a systematic increase in the results for $R$, improving the consistency of the polarization transfer data in the high-$Q^2$ region. This increase is the result of an improved selection of elastic events which largely removes the systematic effect of the inelastic contamination, underestimated by the original analysis.},

In this letter, we report new measurements of the proton electromagnetic form factor ratio using the recoil polarization method, at momentum transfers Q2=5.2, 6.7, and 8.5 GeV2. By extending the range of Q2 for which GEp is accurately determined by more than 50%, these measurements will provide significant constraints on models of nucleon structure in the non-perturbative regime.},

  Abstract                 = {We report the results of a new Rosenbluth measurement of the proton form factors at Q^2 values of 2.64, 3.20 and 4.10 GeV^2. Cross sections were determined by detecting the recoiling proton in contrast to previous measurements in which the scattered electron was detected. At each Q^2, relative cross sections were determined to better than 1%. The measurement focussed on the extraction of G_E/G_M which was determined to 4-8% and found to approximate form factor scaling, i.e. \mu_p G_E \approx G_M. These results are consistent with and much more precise than previous Rosenbluth extractions. However, they are inconsistent with recent polarization transfer measurements of comparable precision, implying a systematic difference between the two techniques.},

Whereas, in the Majorana fermions case we have two essentially different limits of the resulting cross-section and quantitively the answer strongly depends on a spectrum of the masses entering the problem.},

A model for the light-front wave function $\Psi(x,k_\bot)$ is proposed that produces such a distribution amplitude and has a rapidly decreasing (exponential for definiteness) dependence on the light-front energy combination $k_\bot^2/x(1-x)$. It is shown that this model easily reproduces the fit of recent large-$Q^2$ BABAR data on the photon-pion transition form factor.

Invariant matrix elements, cross-sections and transition rates are calculated to leading order in a 1/N_c expansion. Four independent classes, u\bar d, u\bar s, u\bar u and s\bar s\to hadrons are analysed, and the yield is found to be dominated by pion production. Threshold behaviour is determined by the exothermic or endothermic nature of the processes constituting the hadronization class. A strong suppression of transition rates is found at the pionic Mott temperature T_{M\pi}=212 MeV, at which the pion becomes a resonant state. The mean time for hadronization is calculated to be 2-4 fm/c near the Mott temperature. The calculation of strangeness changing processes indicates that hadronization accounts for a 1% increase in the absolute value of the kaon to pion ratio at T=150 MeV.},

This asymmetry, which is induced by the interference of the one-photon exchange amplitude with the parity-odd part of the $Z^0$-exchange amplitude, is calculated for the $\gamma^*(Z^*)+p\to N+\pi$ processes ($\gamma^*$ is a virtual photon and $Z^*$ a virtual Z-boson) considering the $\Delta$-contribution in the $s-$channel, the standard Born contributions and vector meson ($\rho$ and $\omega$) exchanges in the $t-$channel. Taking into account the known isotopic properties of the hadron electromagnetic and neutral currents, we show that the P-odd term is the sum of two contributions. The main term is model independent and it can be calculated exactly in terms of fundamental constants. It is found to be linear in $Q^2$. The second term is a relatively small correction which is determined by the isoscalar component of the electromagnetic current. Near threshold and in the $\Delta$-region, this isoscalar part is much smaller (in absolute value) than the isovector one: its contribution to the asymmetry depend on the polarization state (longitudinal or transverse) of the virtual photon.},

After truncation of the two-body channels to the scalar and axial-vector diquarks, a relativistic Faddeev equation for nucleon bound states is solved in the covariant diquark-quark picture. The dependence of the nucleon mass on diquark masses is studied in detail. We find parameters that lead to a simultaneous reasonable description of pions and nucleons. Both the diquarks contribute attractively to the nucleon mass. Axial-vector diquark correlations are seen to be important, especially in the confining phase of the model. We study the possible implications of quark confinement for the description of the diquarks and the nucleon. In particular, we find that it leads to a more compact nucleon.},

I improve this approximation by additionally taking into account the sunset diagrams, which lead to 4-momentum dependent real and imaginary parts of the Dyson-Schwinger equations. By solving these and the equation for the chiral condensate selfconsistently, one obtains the decay width and the spectral density of the sigma-meson. I compare the results in the case with explicit chiral symmetry breaking with the chiral limit. I found that the 4-momentum dependent real part of the selfenergy does not lead to major qualitative changes in the spectral density.},

This formula contains certain parameters which depend on the action of the virtual photon and meson fields. In particular, curves have been calculated on the assumption of scalar and pseudoscalar meson theory. While these perturbation theory calculations are not very trustworthy, and the results depend on the choice of coupling constants, it is felt that qualitative features can be checked with experiment. It is concluded that at low relativistic energies ($E<50~\MeV$) the experiment provides a valuable check on quantum electrodynamics. At higher energies it should yield data on the nature of the meson cloud of the proton.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a spectral quark model which can be applied to low energy hadronic physics. The approach is based on a generalization of the Lehmann representation of the quark propagator. We work at the one-quark-loop level. Electromagnetic and chiral invariance are ensured with help of the gauge technique which provides particular solutions to the Ward-Takahashi identities. General conditions on the quark spectral function follow from natural physical requirements. In particular, the function is normalized, its all positive moments must vanish, while the physical observables depend on negative moments and the so-called log-moments. As a consequence, the model is made finite, dispersion relations hold, chiral anomalies are preserved, and the twist expansion is free from logarithmic scaling violations, as requested of a low-energy model. We study a variety of processes and show that the framework is very simple and practical. Finally, incorporating the idea of vector-meson dominance, we present an explicit construction of the quark spectral function which satisfies all the requirements. The corresponding momentum representation of the resulting quark propagator exhibits only cuts on the physical axis, with no poles present anywhere in the complex momentum space. The momentum-dependent quark mass compares very well to recent lattice calculations. A large number of predictions and relations can be deduced from our approach for such quantities as the pion light-cone wave function, non-local quark condensate, pion transition form factor, pion valence parton distribution function, etc.},

In the chiral limit we obtain the simple results, namely phi_pi(x)=1 for the pion distribution amplitude, and <k_perp^2> = -M <ubar u> / f_pi^2 for the second moment of the pion light-cone wave function, where M is the constituent quark mass and f_pi is the pion decay constant. After the QCD Gegenbauer evolution of the pion distribution amplitude good end-point behavior is recovered, and a satisfactory agreement with the analysis of the experimental data from CLEO is achieved. This allows us to determine the momentum scale corresponding to our model calculation, which is close to the value Q_0 = 313 MeV obtained earlier from the analogous analysis of the pion parton distribution function. The value of <k_perp^2> is, after the QCD evolution, around (400 MeV)^2. In addition, the model predicts a linear integral relation between the pion distribution amplitude and the parton distribution function of the pion, which holds at the leading-order QCD evolution.},

Here we perform an independent check of his results in fourth and sixth order by analytical means, using expansions in the small mass ratios which occur in the computation. Our result for the fourth-order contribution is $a(4)\mu-a(4)e=5 904 475.1(3)\times10^{-12}$. This is to be compared with Kinoshita's result $a(4)\mu-a(4)e=5 904 485\times10^{-12}$.

  Abstract                 = {In the large $N_c$ approximation to $QCD$, the leading $\pp$ scattering amplitude is expressed as the sum of an infinite number of tree diagrams. We investigate the possibility that an adequate approximation at energies up to somewhat more than one $GeV$ can be made by keeping diagrams which involve the exchange of resonances in this energy range in addition to the simplest chiral contact terms. In this approach crossing symmetry is automatic but individual terms tend to drastically violate partial wave unitarity. We first note that the introduction of the $\rho$ meson in a chirally invariant manner substantially delays the onset of drastic unitarity violation which would be present for the {\it current algebra} term alone. This suggests a possibility of local (in energy) cancellation which we then explore in a phenomenological way. We include exchanges of leading resonances up to the $1.3 GeV$ region. However, unitarity requires more structure which we model by a four derivative contact term or by a low lying scalar resonance which is presumably subleading in the $\1N$ expansion, but may nevertheless be important. The latter two flavor model gives a reasonable description of the phase shift $\delta^0_0$ up until around $860 MeV$, before the effects associated which the $K\bar{K}$ threshold come into play.},

Since the instanton density and the confinement scale vary with density in a very different way, instantons are clearly distinguishable from other possible mechanisms. There is an instanton prediction for the $\eta'$ mass at large density that can be compared to lattice results. The density dependence of the instanton contribution is a simple consequence of the integer topological charge carried by the instanton. We also argue that $N_c=3$ color QCD at finite isospin density can be used in order to study the origin of OZI-violation in the scalar sector.},

In the case of $V+A$ the instanton calculation is in good agreement with the data once perturbative corrections are included. These corrections clearly show the evolution of $\alpha_s$. We also analyze the range of validity of the Operator Product Expansion (OPE). In the $V-A$ channel we find a dimension $d=6$ contribution which is comparable to the original SVZ estimate, but the instanton model provides a different non-singular term of the same magnitude. In the $V+A$ case both the OPE and the instanton model predict the same $d=4$ power correction induced by the gluon condensate, but it is masked by much larger perturbative contributions. We conclude that the range of validity of the OPE is limited to $x\lsim0.3$ fm, whereas the instanton model describes the data over the entire range.},

  Abstract                 = {In a first part, I review our detailed investigation of the prospects to discover deep-inelastic processes induced by small QCD-instantons at HERA. This includes the essence of our calculations based on instanton-perturbation theory, crucial lattice constraints and a confrontation of the recent intriguing (preliminary) search results by the H1 collaboration with our predictions. In a second part, I report on two ongoing attempts towards a better understanding of the role of larger-size instantons in the QCD-vacuum and in high-energy (diffractive) scattering processes, respectively: The striking suppression of larger-size instantons in the vacuum is attributed to a residual conformal inversion symmetry, and a precocious lack of ``color transparency'' in the one-instanton contribution to the color-dipole scattering picture is emphasized.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider a chirally symmetric bosonization of the $SU(2)$ Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model within the Pauli-Villars regularization scheme. Special attention is paid to the way in which chiral symmetry is broken explicitly. The parameters of the model are fixed in the light of chiral perturbation theory by performing a covariant derivative expansion in the presence of external fields. As a by-product we obtain the corresponding low-energy parameters and pion radii as well as some threshold parameters for pion-pion scattering. The nucleon is obtained in terms of the solitonic solutions of the action in the sector with baryon number equal to one. It is found that for a constituent quark mass $M \sim 350 MeV$ most of the calculated vacuum and pion properties agree reasonably well with the experimental ones and coincide with the region where localized solitons with the right size exist. For this value, however, the scalar and vector pion radii turn out to be very small. A unique determination of the sigma term is proposed, obtaining a value of $\sigma(0) = 41.3 MeV$. The scalar nucleon form factor is evaluated in the Breit frame. The extrapolation to the Cheng-Dashen point leads to $\sigma(2m^2) - \sigma(0) = 7.4 MeV$.},

  Abstract                 = {The discussion of vacuum polarization in the previous paper of this series was confined to that produced by the field of a prescribed current distribution. We now consider the induction of current in the vacuum by an electron, which is a dynamical system and an entity indistinguishable from the particles associated with vacuum fluctuations. The additional current thus attributed to an electron implies an alteration in its electromagnetic properties which will be revealed by scattering in a Coulomb field and by energy level displacements. This paper is concerned with the computation of the second-order corrections to the current operator and the application to electron scattering. Radiative corrections to energy levels will be treated in the next paper of the series. Following a canonical transformation which effectively renormalizes the electron mass, the correction to the current operator produced by the coupling with the electromagnetic field is developed in a power series, of which first- and second-order terms are retained. One thus obtains second-order modifications in the current operator which are of the same general nature as the previously treated vacuum polarization current, save for a contribution that has the form of a dipole current. The latter implies a fractional increase of $\alpha/2\pi$ in the spin magnetic moment of the electron. The only flaw in the second-order current correction is a logarithmic divergence attributable to an infra-red catastrophe. It is remarked that, in the presence of an external field, the first-order current correction will introduce a compensating divergence. Thus, the second-order corrections to particle electromagnetic properties cannot be completely stated without regard for the manner of exhibiting them by an external field. Accordingly, we consider in the second section the interaction of three systems, the matter field, the electromagnetic field, and a given current distribution. It is shown that this situation can be described in terms of an external potential coupled to the current operator, as modified by the interaction with the vacuum electromagnetic field. Application is made to the scattering of an electron by an external field, in which the latter is regarded as a small perturbation. It is found convenient to calculate the total rate at which collisions occur and then identify the cross sections for individual events. The correction to the cross section for radiationless scattering is determined by the second-order correction to the current operator, while scattering that is accompanied by single quantum emission is a consequence of the first-order current correction. The final object of calculation is the differential cross section for scattering through a given angle with a prescribed maximum energy loss, which is completely free of divergences. Detailed evaluations are given in two situations, the essentially elastic scattering of an electron, in which only a small fraction of the kinetic energy is radiated, and the scattering of a slowly moving electron with unrestricted energy loss. The Appendix is devoted to an alternative treatment of the polarization of the vacuum by an external field. The conditions imposed on the induced current by the charge conservation and gauge invariance requirements are examined. It is found that the fulfillment of these formal properties requires the vanishing of an integral that is not absolutely convergent, but naturally vanishes for reasons of symmetry. This null integral is then used to simplify the expression for the induced current in such a manner that direct calculation yields a gauge invariant result. The induced current contains a logarithmically divergent multiple of the external current, which implies that a non-vanishing total charge, proportional to the external charge, is induced in the vacuum. The apparent contradiction with charge conservation is resolved by showing that a compensating charge escapes to infinity. Finally, the expression for the electromagnetic mass of the electron is treated with the methods developed in this paper.},

  Abstract                 = {The covariant formulation of quantum electrodynamics, developed in a previous paper, is here applied to two elementary problemsвЂ”the polarization of the vacuum and the self-energies of the electron and photon. In the first section the vacuum of the non-interacting electromagnetic and matter fields is covariantly defined as that state for which the eigenvalue of an arbitrary time-like component of the energy-momentum four-vector is an absolute minimum. It is remarked that this definition must be compatible with the requirement that the vacuum expectation values of a physical quantity in various coordinate systems should be, not only covariantly related, but identical, since the vacuum has a significance that is independent of the coordinate system. In order to construct a suitable characterization of the vacuum state vector, a covariant decomposition of the field operators into positive and negative frequency components is introduced, and the properties of these associated fields developed. It is shown that the state vector for the electromagnetic vacuum is annihilated by the positive frequency part of the transverse four-vector potential, while that for the matter vacuum is annihilated by the positive frequency part of the Dirac spinor and of its charge conjugate. These defining properties of the vacuum state vector are employed in the calculation of the vacuum expectation values of quadratic field quantities, specifically the energy-momentum tensors of the independent electromagnetic and matter fields, and the current four-vector. It is inferred that the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor, and the current vector must vanish in the vacuum, while the matter field energy-momentum tensor vanishes in the vacuum only by the addition of a suitable multiple of the unit tensor. The second section treats the induction of a current in the vacuum by an external electromagnetic field. It is supposed that the latter does not produce actual electron-positron pairs; that is, we consider only the phenomenon of virtual pair creation. This restriction is introduced by requiring that the establishment and subsequent removal of the external field produce no net change in state for the matter field. It is demonstrated, in a general manner, that the induced current at a given space-time point involves the external current in the vicinity of that point, and not the electromagnetic potentials. This gauge invariant result shows that a light wave, propagating at remote distances from its source, induces no current in the vacuum and is therefore undisturbed in its passage through space. The absence of a light quantum self-energy effect is thus indicated. The current induced at a point consists, more precisely, of two parts: a logarithmically divergent multiple of the external current at that point, which produces an unobservable renormalization of charge, and a more involved finite contribution, which is the physically significant induced current. The latter agrees with the results of previous investigations. The modification of the matter field properties arising from interaction with the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field is considered in the third section. The analysis is carried out with two alternative formulations, one employing the complete electromagnetic potential together with a supplementary condition, the other using the transverse potential, with the variables of the supplementary condition eliminated. It is noted that no real processes are produced by the first order coupling between the fields. Accordingly, alternative equations of motion for the state vector are constructed, from which the first order interaction term has been eliminated and replaced by the second order coupling which it generates. The latter includes the self action of individual particles and light quanta, the interaction of different particles, and a coupling between particles and light quanta which produces such effects as Compton scattering and two quantum pair annihilation. It is concluded from a comparison of the alternative procedures that, for the treatment of virtual light quantum processes, the separate consideration of longitudinal and transverse fields is an inadvisable complication. The light quantum self-energy term is shown to vanish, while that for a particle has the anticipated form for a change in proper mass, although the latter is logarithmically divergent, in agreement with previous calculations. To confirm the identification of the self-energy effect with a change in proper mass, it is shown that the result of removing this term from the state vector equation of motion is to alter the matter field equations of motion in the expected manner. It is verified, finally, that the energy and momentum modifications produced by self-interaction effects are entirely accounted for by the addition of the electromagnetic proper mass to the mechanical proper mass -- an unobservable mass renormalization. An appendix is devoted to the construction of several invariant functions associated with the electromagnetic and matter fields.},

  Abstract                 = {Attempts to avoid the divergence difficulties of quantum electrodynamics by multilation of the theory have been uniformly unsuccessful. The lack of convergence does indicate that a revision of electrodynamic concepts at ultrarelativistic energies is indeed necessary, but no appreciable alteration of the theory for moderate relativistic energies can be tolerated. The elementary phenomena in which divergences occur, in consequence of virtual transitions involving particles with unlimited energy, are the polarization of the vacuum and the self-energy of the electron, effects which essentially express the interaction of the electromagnetic and matter fields with their own vacuum fluctuations. The basic result of these fluctuation interactions is to alter the constants characterizing the properties of the individual fields, and their mutual coupling, albeit by infinite factors. The question is naturally posed whether all divergences can be isolated in such unobservable renormalization factors; more specifically, we inquire whether quantum electrodynamics can account unambiguously for the recently observed deviations from the Dirac electron theory, without the introduction of fundamentally new concepts. This paper, the first in a series devoted to the above question, is occupied with the formulation of a completely covariant electrodynamics. Manifest covariance with respect to Lorentz and gauge transformations is essential in a divergent theory since the use of a particular reference system or gauge in the course of calculation can result in a loss of covariance in view of the ambiguities that may be the concomitant of infinities. It is remarked, in the first section, that the customary canonical commutation relations, which fail to exhibit the desired covariance since they refer to field variables at equal times and different points of space, can be put in covariant form by replacing the four-dimensional surface t=const. by a space-like surface. The latter is such that light signals cannot be propagated between any two points on the surface. In this manner, a formulation of quantum electrodynamics is constructed in the Heisenberg representation, which is obviously covariant in all its aspects. It is not entirely suitable, however, as a practical means of treating electrodynamic questions, since commutators of field quantities at points separated by a time-like interval can be constructed only by solving the equations of motion. This situation is to be contrasted with that of the Schr\"odinger representation, in which all operators refer to the same time, thus providing a distinct separation between kinematical and dynamical aspects. A formulation that retains the evident covariance of the Heisenberg representation, and yet offers something akin to the advantage of the Schr\"odinger representation can be based on the distinction between the properties of non-interacting fields, and the effects of coupling between fields. In the second section, we construct a canonical transformation that changes the field equations in the Heisenberg representation into those of non-interacting fields, and therefore describes the coupling between fields in terms of a varying state vector. It is then a simple matter to evaluate commutators of field quantities at arbitrary space-time points. One thus obtains an obviously convariant and practical form of quantum electrodynamics, expressed in a mixed Heisenberg-Schr\"odinger representation, which is called the interaction representation. The third section is devoted to a discussion of the covariant elimination of the longitudinal field, in which the customary distinction between longitudinal and transverse fields is replaced by a suitable covariant definition. The fourth section is concerned with the description of collision processes in terms of an invariant collision operator, which is the unitary operator that determines the over-all change in state of a system as the result of interaction. It is shown that the collision operator is simply related to the Hermitian reaction operator, for which a variational principle is constructed.},

  Abstract                 = {A survey of the literature dealing with the quark-model configurations of the scalar-isoscalar light mesons suggests that a theoretical model is needed to deal with these characterizations, since various researchers have come to widely different conclusions concerning the nature of the $\sigma(500 600)$ or the $f_0(980)$, basing their analysis on an attempt to fit experimental data with models for the wave functions of these states. In an earlier work we demonstrated that our generalized Nambu Jona-Lasinio model may be used to provide a very good fit to the mixing angles and decay constants of the $\eta(547)$ and $\eta'(958)$ mesons. It was found that the $\eta(547)$ was mainly a flavor octet state. On the other hand, when we use our model to describe the scalar-isoscalar $f_0(980)$ meson, we find that it is mainly a singlet state, in agreement with the recent suggestion of Ochs. We stress that these results for the properties of the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons arise from the different behavior of the вЂ™t Hooft interaction in the two cases. In this work we demonstrate that the singlet-octet flavor representation largely brings the interaction matrix to diagonal form, with some residual singlet-octet mixing due, in part, to the вЂ™t Hooft interaction and to the difference of the up (or down) and the strange quark constituent mass values. We find that, if we neglect the coupling to the two-meson continuum and use the same interaction that was used in our study of the $\eta$ mesons, the $f_0(980)$ has a mass of 981 MeV and is the $q\bar q$ state of lowest energy. That result implies that the $\sigma(500 600)$ is not a $q\bar q$ state, but is generated dynamically in $\pi\pi$ scattering, as well have discussed in an earlier work. We suggest that the proper treatment of the вЂ™t Hooft interaction leads to a unified interpretation of the pseudoscalar and scalar meson characteristics.},

We show how the constraints of gauge invariance affect the calculations of such diagrams, if the $q \bar q$ system has the quantum numbers of the rho or omega mesons. In the NJL model without confinement, gauge invariance may be maintained by using a regularization scheme that respects that symmetry. Alternatively, gauge-invariance constraints may be imposed by introducing a substraction procedure when evaluating the $q\bar q$ loop integrals (vacuum polarization diagrams). We discuss the merits of such subtraction procedures in the presence of a confining interaction. We also provide a calculation of the vacuum polarization diagrams of the NJL model that includes the effects of confinement and also satisfies the constraints imposed by gauge invariance. Our analysis provides some justification for the subtraction procedure used in several studies of the NJL model. We also show, in a rather clear fashion, how confinement serves to change the analytic properties of the polarization tensors, so that the tensor for the theory with confinement has only a physical cut structure in the region of interest.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent work has shown that the singlet-octet mixing angles of the $\eta(547)$ and $\eta'(958)$ are different. That may be demonstrated either in extended chiral perturbation theory or by analysis of a large body of experimental data. The conclusion is that the $\eta(547)$ is almost entirely of octet character, while the $\eta'(958)$ is mainly of singlet character with about 10\% octet component. It is possible to calculate the mixing angles and decay constants in our generalized Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, which includes a covariant model of confinement. Our model is able to give a good account of the mass values of the $\eta(547)$, $\eta'(958)$, $\eta(1295)$, and $\eta(1440)$ mesons. (We also provide predictions for the mass values of a large number of radially excited states.) It is well known that the $U_A(1)$ symmetry is broken, so that we only have eight pseudo Goldstone bosons, rather than the nine we would have otherwise. In the NJL model that feature may be introduced by including the 't Hooft interaction in the Lagrangian. That interaction reduces the energy of the octet state somewhat and significantly increases the energy of the singlet state, making it possible to fit the mass values of the $\eta(547)$ and $\eta'(958)$ in the NJL model when the 't Hooft interaction is included. In this work, we derive the equations of a covariant random phase approximation that may be used to study the nonet of pseudoscalar mesons. We demonstrate that a consistent treatment of the 't Hooft interaction leads to excellent results for the singlet-octet mixing angles. (The values obtained for the singlet and octet decay constants are also quite satisfactory.) It may be seen that the difference between the up (or down) constituent quark mass and the strange quark mass induces singlet-octet mixing that is too large. However, the 't Hooft interaction contains singlet-octet coupling that enters into the theory with a sign opposite to that of the term arising from the difference of the quark mass values, leading to quite satisfactory results. In this work we present the wave function amplitudes for a number of states of the eta mesons. (The inclusion of pseudoscalar-axial-vector coupling is important for our analysis and results in the need to specify eight wave function amplitudes for each state of the eta mesons.) We present the values of the various constants that parametrize our generalized NJL model and which give satisfactory values of the eta meson masses, decay constants, and mixing angles. It is found that the calculated mass values for the $\eta(1295)$ and $\eta(1440)$ are quite insensitive to variation of the parameters of the model whose values have largely been fixed in our earlier studies of other light mesons.},

  Abstract                 = {In an earlier work we calculated the continuum contribution to the hadronic current correlator for pseudoscalar and scalar-isovector currents. In this work we extend our considerations to the study of a scalar-isoscalar correlator of scalar operators. In this formalism we explore the distribution of $q\bar q$ strength as a function of energy. We perform a covariant random-phase approximation calculation of the scalar-isoscalar states using parameters that have been determined in earlier studies of pseudoscalar and vector mesons. The state of lowest energy that we find can be identified with the $f_0(980)$. We find very little $q\bar q$ strength for energies less than the energy of the $f_0(980)$. That suggests that the nonlinear sigma model is the model of choice, since there is no low-lying scalar state of $q\bar q$ character in our model. [The $f_0(400-1200)$, which now appears in the data tables, may be understood as a "dynamically generated"' state that appears when one studies $\pi\pi$ scattering. In our analysis it is not a $q \bar q$ state. In the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, chiral symmetry requires the same interaction strength GS for scalar and pseudoscalar states. If we wished to obtain a scalar state at about 600 MeV, we would require a major violation of chiral symmetry, such that GS for scalar states would be about 50% larger than the value determined from our study of the pseudoscalar mesons.] We conclude that, except for certain limited applications that we have described in earlier work, the linear sigma model, which describes a low-energy $q \bar q$ state of mass of about 500-600 MeV, does not provide a correct description of the physical spectrum.},

  Abstract                 = {A powerful technique for the calculation of hadronic properties is the application of QCD sum rules in a study of correlation functions. The calculation of hadronic current correlation functions may be carried out using the operator-product expansion. The correlator may also be represented by hadronic states, which include one or more discrete levels and a continuum contribution. Comparison of the two methods of calculation of the same correlator allows for the determination of hadronic parameters after one estimates the continuum contribution and specifies the values of the vacuum condensates. In this work we consider two types of contribution to the continuum. The first involves the radially excited states of a meson. These states appear as resonances which ultimately decay into the continuum of multimeson states. In a second process, the multimeson continuum is reached in a direct process, without the excitation of a resonance. For the resonances, we calculate the contribution to the hadronic correlator by calculating the meson decay constants in the region $0<P^2<6 GeV^2$, making use of our generalized Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, which includes a covariant model of confinement. [Our model provides a good fit to the decay constants of the $a_0(1450)$ and $K^*_0 (1430)$ mesons. Our value for the $a_0(980)$ is about 60\% larger than the value obtained by Maltman using QCD sum rules. Also, our values for the pion and kaon decay constants are about $35$ and $10\%$ too large, respectively. We have not performed any parameter variations to improve upon these values.] The second contribution to the correlator arises from the direct excitation of multimeson continuum states. For the $a_0(980)$ and its radial excitations, we calculate both the resonant and direct contributions. In the case of the isovector pseudoscalar states we calculate the resonance contribution and parametrize the direct multimeson contribution so as to reproduce a phenomenological expression of the quark-hadron duality model. In this case the calculated resonance contribution is about 15% of the phenomenological result after a Borel transformation is made. The resonance contribution plus a quark-hadron duality model contribution with $s_0=1.65 GeV^2$ yields a good fit to the phenomenological form. In this phenomenological form only the quark-hadron duality model is used with $s_0=1.53 GeV^2$. We also provide values of the resonance contribution to the continuum strength in the case of the strange pseudoscalar states. In the case of the isovector scalar mesons we find significant disagreement between our microscopic calculations and the result of the quark-duality model for the continuum of the hadronic current correlator. Indeed, the contribution of the resonances to the continuum is a least an order of magnitude larger than the values obtained from the quark-hadron duality model. That result may suggest an explanation for the problems encountered by some authors who have studied the isovector scalar mesons using QCD sum rules.},

In the first part the physical meaning of the anomaly is demonstrated. To this end the simplest gauge model is considered - the two-dimensional Schwinger model. In this model it is extremely easy to explain which properties of the theory are responsible for the quantum anomaly, and the physical nature of the phenomenon is elucidated. The second part is devoted to the derivation of the anomaly relations within QCD. The subtle question of the multiloop corrections is discussed. The third part presents applications. Starting from the chiral and scale anomalies we obtain low-energy theorems which lead, in turn, to predictions for observable processes. In particular, a proof based on first principles is given of the existence of massless pions, the amplitudes are calculated for the conversion of gluon operators into pions, which can be measured experimentally. Other practical problems are also considered, the solution of which turns out to be possible due to anomalies.},

This number is close to that resulting from the well-known pseudoscalar meson analysis.

  Abstract                 = {A systematic study is made of the non-perturbative effects in quantum chromodynamics. The basic object is the two-point functions of various currents. At large Euclidean momenta q the non-perturbative contributions induce a series in $(\mu^2/q^2)$ where $\mu$ is some typical hadronic mass. The terms of this series are shown to be of two distinct types. The first few of them are connected with vacuum fluctuations of large size, and can be consistently accounted for within the Wilson operator expansion. On the other hand, in high orders small-size fluctuations show up and the high-order terms do not reduce (generally speaking) to the vacuum-to-vacuum matrix elements of local operators. This signals the breakdown of the operator expansion. The corresponding critical dimension is found. We propose a Borel improvement of the power series. On one hand, it makes the two-point functions less sensitive to high-order terms, and on the other hand, it transforms the standard dispersion representation into a certain integral representation with exponential weight functions. As a result we obtain a set of the sum rules for the observable spectral densities which correlate the resonance properties to a few vacuum-to-vacuum matrix elements. As the last bid to specify the sum rules we estimate the matrix elements involved and elaborate several techniques for this purpose.},

We extend first the dispersion charmonium theory to include power terms due to the non-perturbative effects of QCD. As a byproduct, an estimate for the gluonic vacuum expectation value, $<0|G_{\mu\nu}^a G_{\mu\nu}^a|0>$, emerges. The main emphasis is made on the analysis of the $\rho$, $\omega$, $K^*$ mesons. Predictions are formulated for integrals of the type $\int \Im \Pi_{e^-}(s)/M^2 ds$ where $\Im \Pi$ is an appropriate spectral density. It is shown that there exist such $M^2$ that the integrals are dominated by a single resonance, on one hand, and are calculable in a reliable way, on the other. As a result we are able to calculate the resonance coupling constants and masses. The typical accuracy achieved is about 10%. The power terms considered explain both the $\pi-A_1$ mass splittings and the observed pattern of the $SU(3)$ symmetry breaking in the vector nonet.

Good diquarks, i.e. the $0^{+}$ states of two quarks, are argued to have a two-component structure with one of the components peaking at distances several times shorter than a typical hadron size (a short-range core). This can play a role in solving two old puzzles of the 't Hooft 1/N expansion: strong quark mass dependence of the vacuum energy density and strong violations of the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule in the quark-antiquark $0^\pm$ channels. In both cases empiric data defy 't Hooft's 1/N suppression. If good diquarks play a role at an intermediate energy scale they ruin 't Hoofts planarity because of their mixed-flavor composition. This new scale associated with the good diquarks may be related to a numerically large scale discovered in [V. Novikov, M. Shifman, A. Vainshtein and V. Zakharov, Nucl. Phys. B 191, 301 (1981)] in a number of phenomena mostly related to vacuum quantum numbers and $0^\pm$ glueball channels. If SU(3)$_{\rm color}$ of bona fide QCD is replaced by SU(2)$_{\rm color}$, diquarks become well-defined gauge invariant objects. Moreover, there is an exact symmetry relating them to pions. In this limit predictions regarding good diquarks are iron-clad. If passage from SU(2)$_{\rm color}$ to SU(3)$_{\rm color}$ does not lead to dramatic disturbances, these predictions remain qualitatively valid in bona fide QCD.},

The proposed {\sf "massive analytic pQCD"} is constructed on the two grounds. The first is the pQCD with only one parameter added, the effective "glueball mass" $m_{gl}\lesssim 1 \GeV,$ serving as an IR regulator. The second stems out of the ghost-free Analytic Perturbation Theory comprising non-power perturbative expansion that makes it compatible with linear integral transformations.

There exists an attempt to reconcile this discrepancy by introducing a light gluino \gl in the MSSM. \par We study in detail the influence of heavy thresholds on \alpha_s(Q) evolution. First, we consruct the "exact" explicit solution to the mass-dependent two-loop RG equation for the running \alpha_s(Q). This solution describes heavy thresholds smoothly. Second, we use this solution to recalculate anew \alpha_s(M_Z) values corresponding to "low-energy" input data. Our analysis demonstrates that using {\it mass-dependent RG procedure} generally produces corrections of two types: Asymptotic correction due to effective shift of threshold position; Local threshold correction only for the case when input experiment lies in the close vicinity of heavy particle threshold: $Q_{expt} \approx M_h$. Both effects result in the effective shift of the \asmz values of the order of $10&{-3}$. However, the second one could be enhanced when the gluino mass is close to a heavy quark mass. For such a case the sum effect could be important for the discussion of the light gluino existence as it further changes the \gl mass.},

But it ultimately leads to unphysical singularities of observables in the infrared domain. The analytic perturbation theory is the next step in improving the perturbative expansions. Specifically, it involves an additional analyticity requirement based on the causality principle and implemented in the K\"allenвЂ“Lehmann and JostвЂ“Lehmann representations. This approach eliminates spurious singularities of the perturbative power series and enhances the stability of the series with respect to both higher-loop corrections and the choice of the renormalization scheme. This paper is an overview of the basic stages in developing the analytic perturbation theory in QCD, including its recent applications to describing hadronic processes.},

The new and crucial result is that the condensation of scalar isoscalar field which is a usual onset of chiral symmetry breaking and is constant in space-time, assumes here the form of the confining string and contributes to the confining potential, while the rest bosonic fields describe mesons with the q\bar q quark structure and pseudoscalars play the role of Nambu-Goldstone fields.

The expressions for the invariant charge and matrix elements are then modified such that the nonphysical singularities of the ghost pole type do not appear at all: additional nonperturbative contributions compensate them by construction. With the new scheme, the calculation results for several physical processes are stable with respect to higher-loop effects and the choice of the renormalization prescription. Having applications of the new formulation to inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering processes in mind, we analyze the corresponding structure functions starting from general principles of the theory in the Jost-Lehmann-Dyson integral representation. A nonstandard scaling variable leads to modified moments of the structure functions possessing K\"allen-Lehmann analytic properties with respect to $Q^2$. We find the relation between these вЂњmodified analytic momentsвЂќ and the operator product expansion.},

The individual determination of the moduli of the electric and magnetic proton form factors will be possible up to a value of momentum transfer squared of $q^2\simeq 14$ (GeV/c)$^2$. The total $\bar p +p\to e^++e^-$ cross section will be measured up to $q^2\simeq 28$ (GeV/c)$^2$. The results obtained from simulated events are compared to the existing data.

Effects are found to be significant compared to standard $\pi$-$\pi$ and $K$-${\bar K}$ annihilations. While the mixing in the isoscalar channel mostly gives a contribution in the invariant mass range between the two-pion threshold and the $\omega$ peak, the isovector channel mixing induces an additional peak just below that of the $\phi$.

The pole positions and the values of the imaginary parts of the self-energy for different polarization states have different functional dependences on $M$ and $||p||$. The corresponding dielectron rate (calculated from the imaginary part of the in-medium $\rho$-meson propagator) shows a distinctive asymmetry when the momentum $t=p^+-p^-$ is perpendicular or parallel to $p$, where $p^\pm$ are the $e^\pm$ momenta of the electron pair.},

Far above the threshold, the helicities of $l^+$ and $l^-$ tend to be opposite to each other. Near the threshold the directions of spins of $l^+$ and $l^-$ prefer to be parallel to each other, and the sum of the two spins prefers to be either parallel or anti-parallel to the direction of the incident electron. Because the parity conservation is violated maximally in the decays of $l^+$ and $l^-$, the angular distributions of decay products depend strongly on the spin orientation of the heavy leptons. Since the spins of $l^+$ and $l^-$ are strongly correlated in the production, we found a strong correlation between the energy-angle distributions of the decay products of $l^+$ and $l^-$. The decay widths of $l^-$ into channels $\nu_l \bar nu_e e^-$, $\nu_l \bar \nu_\mu \mu^-$, $\nu_l \pi^-$, $\nu_l K^-$, $\nu+l \rho^-$, $\nu+l K^*$, $\nu_l A_1$, $\nu_l Q$, and $\nu_l+hadron$ continuum as functions of the mass of $l^-$ are estimated.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper examines various aspects of black-hole evaporation. A two-dimensional model is investigated where it is shown that using fermion-boson cancellation on the stress-energy tensor reduces the energy outflow to zero, while other noncovariant techniques give the Hawking result. A technique for replacing the collapse by boundary conditions on the past horizon is developed which retains the essential features of the collapse while eliminating some of the difficulties. This set of boundary conditions is also suggested as the most natural set for a preexistent black hole. The behavior of particle detectors under acceleration is investigated where it is shown that an accelerated detector even in flat spacetime will detect particles in the vacuum. The similarity of this case with the behavior of a detector near the black hole is brought out, and it is shown that a geodesic detector near the horizon will not see the Hawking flux of particles. Finally, the work of Berger, Chitre, Nutku, and Moncrief on scalar geons is corrected, and the spherically symmetric coupled scalar-gravitation Hamiltonian is presented in the hope that someone can apply it to the problem of black-hole evaporation.},

The model describes dynamical quark mass generation and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and includes effects of the axial $U(1)$ anomaly. Mesons emerge as quark-antiquark modes; their spectra and properties are discussed. Properties of constituent quarks as quasi-particles, dressed by their strong interactions, are summarized. The quark-diquark structure of baryons is developed, and a brief summary is given on baryonic solitons as they result from the NJL model. Finally, selected implications for nuclear physics are described, such as the change of hadron structure in a dense and hot nuclear medium.},

Two different approaches to the solution of this problem are given as an example. In the first case, meson fields are introduced as a chiral phase of quark fields and external sources directly in the QCD Lagrangian. In other papers, mesons are treated as composite quark-antiquark objects. More attention is paid to the Nambu - Jona-Lasinio model, from the second group of models, and to its various physical applications. The main advantage of the last model is its mechanism of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry.

The works devoted to the construction of phenomenological lagrangians for strong and electromagnetic meson interactions at low energies on the ground of the model with four-quark interaction of the superconductivity type are reviewed. The scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and two axial-vector meson nonets are considered. It is shown that the light current quarks turn into the heavy constituent quarks because of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The strong and radiative decays of the five meson nonets, pp- and pK-scattering lengths, electromagnetic radii and polarizabilities of the pion and kaon are described.},

  Abstract                 = {The photon pair production by pion annihilation in a hot and dense medium at the chiral phase transition is investigated within a chiral quark model. As a direct consequence of this transition the $\sigma$ meson appears as a bound state in the domain of temperatures and chemical potentials where the condition $M_\sigma(T,\mu)\approx 2 M_\pi(T,\mu)$ is fulfilled. This effect results in a strong enhancement of the cross section for the pion annihilation process $2 \pi \to 2 \gamma$ compared with the vacuum case. The calculation of the photon pair production rate as function of the invariant mass shows a strong enhancement and narrowing of the $\sigma$ meson resonance at threshold due to chiral symmetry restoration.},

The mechanisms of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and vector dominance are shown. The local NJL model allows us to describe the mass spectrum and main strong and electroweak decays of the four ground-state nonets of pseudoscalar, scalar, vector and axial-vector mesons. Applications of this model to the description of mesons in hot and dense medium are discussed. It is shown that for solving problems connected with the description of the meson radial excitations and quark confinement it is necessary to consider a nonlocal extension of the NJL model. The main attention is attracted to the description of the methods used in different versions of the NJL model. Physical results for low-energy hadron physics obtained in these models can be found in the cited works.},

The Lagrangian is derived by bosonization of a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) type quark model with separable nonlocal interactions. The nonlocality is described by form factors corresponding to 3-dimensional excited state wave functions. The spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is governed by the standard NJL gap equations. A simple SU(2)xSU(2) version of the model is used to demonstrate all low-energy theorems to hold valid in the chiral limit. A more realistic U(3)xU(3) model with 't Hooft interaction is constructed to describe the mass spectrum of excited scalar, pseudoscalar, and vector mesons. On the basis of global chiral symmetry, we use the same form factors for the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons. Having fixed the form factor parameters by masses of pseudoscalar mesons, we predict the mass spectrum of scalar mesons. This allows us to interpret experimentally observed scalar, pseudoscalar, and vector meson states as members of quark-antiquark nonets. It is shown that the a_0(1450), K^*_0(1430), f_0(1370), f_J(1710) scalar meson states are the first radial excitations of the ground states: a_0(980), K^*_0(960), f_0(400-1200), f_0(980).

Comparisons are made to theoretical models, including those based on perturbative QCD, vector-meson dominance, QCD sum rules, and diquark constituents in the proton. The results for $G_E^p$ are somewhat larger than indicated by most theoretical parametrizations, and the ratios of the Pauli and Dirac form factors $Q^2(F_2^p/F_1^p)$ are lower in value and demonstrate a weaker $Q^2$ dependence than those predictions. A global extraction of the elastic form factors from several experiments in the range $0.1 0.1 < Q^2 < 10~(\GeV/c)^2$ is also presented.},

  Abstract                 = {We explore possible realizations of chiral symmetry, based on isotopic multiplets of fields whose transformation rules involve only isotopic-spin matrices and the pion field. The transformation rules are unique, up to possible redefinitions of the pion field. Chiral-invariant Lagrangians can be constructed by forming isotopic-spin-conserving functions of a covariant pion derivative, plus other fields and their covariant derivatives. The resulting models are essentially equivalent to those that have been derived by treating chirality as an ordinary linear symmetry broken by the vacuum, except that we do not have to commit ourselves as to the grouping of hadrons into chiral multiplets; as a result, the unrenormalized value of $g_A/g_V$ need not be unity. We classify the possible choices of the chiral-symmetry-breaking term in the Lagrangian according to their chiral transformation properties, and give the values of the pion-pion scattering lengths for each choice. If the symmetry-breaking term has the simplest possible transformation properties, then the scattering lengths are those previously derived from current algebra. An alternative method of constructing chiral-invariant Lagrangians, using $\rho$ mesons to form covariant derivatives, is also presented. In this formalism, $\rho$ dominance is automatic, and the current-algebra result from the $\rho$-meson coupling constant arises from the independent assumption that $\rho$ mesons couple universally to pions and other particles. Including $\rho$ mesons in the Lagrangian has no effect on the $\pi-\pi$ scattering lengths, because chiral invariance requires that we also include direct pion self-couplings which cancel the $\rho$-exchange diagrams for pion energies near threshold.},

The smaller value ofmo reduces the phase space for sigma-> pi+pi -, which suppresses the hadronic rate; the CPviolating media allows the sigma to decay to lepton pairs by one photon, which increases the leptonic rate.

Lower PMOD TSI during the maximum of cycle 21 results from modifications of Nimbus7/ERB and ACRIM1 published results that produces better agreement with a TSI/solar proxy model [ Foukal and Lean, 1988 ; Lean et al., 1995 ; Froehlich and Lean, 1998 ].},

Partial restoration of chiral symmetry is modeled by the decrease of in-medium pion decay constant f*_{pi}. For large chiral restoration (f*_{pi}/f_{pi} << 1), 2nd sheet poles in the scalar (sigma) and the vector (rho) mesons are both dictated by the Lambert W function and show universal softening as f*_{pi} decreases. In-medium pi-pi cross section receives substantial contribution from the soft mode and exhibits a large enhancement in low-energy region. Fate of this universality for small chiral restoration (f*_{pi}/f_{pi} ~ 1) is also discussed.},

The results show no evidence of anomalous two-photon effects and verify the correctness of the first Born approximation form factor analysis to within a few percent or better for this range of q2. The variation of the cross sections with q2 has also been measured with high accuracy.
The specific ionizations of 300-MeV positrons and electrons in hydrogen at one atmosphere have been compared in the course of the experiment, and found to be equal to within В±0.3%.},

By identifying the leading meson loop transitions and constraining the model parameters with the available experimental data for $\psi(3770) \to J/\psi \eta$ and $\phi\eta$, we succeed in making a quantitative prediction for all $\psi(3770) \to VP$ with $BR_{VP} \approx 1.39$. This is an indication that the OZI-rule-evading long-range interactions are still playing a role in $\psi(3770)$ strong decays, and they are a key towards a full understanding of the large non-$D\bar{D}$ branching ratios observed in experiment.},

The NLO QCD corrections can reduce the scale dependence of the leading order (LO) cross section. The K-factor (defined as the ratio of the NLO cross section to the LO one) does not depend on $\tan\beta$ if the same quark running masses are used in the NLO and LO cross sections, and varies roughly from $\sim 1.6$ to $\sim 1.8$ when charged Higgs boson mass increases from 200 GeV to 1000 GeV.},

A similar reduction also occurs for the electron-electron atomic parity violating interaction.

We give the Feynman rules and the explicit form of the counter terms of the electroweak standard model, we list analytical expressions for scalar one-loop integrals and reduction of tensor integrals, we present the decomposition of the invariant matrix element for processes with two external fermions and we give the analytic form of soft photonic corrections. These techniques are applied to physical processes with external W-bosons. We present the full set of analytical formulae and the corresponding numerical results for the decay width of the W-boson and the top quark. We discuss the cross section for the production of W-bosons in e^{+}e^{-}-annihilaton including all O(alpha) radiative corrections and finite width effects. Improved Born approximations for these processes are given.},

When lattice vibration is artificially introduced to the photonic crystal, a governing equation of electromagnetic field is derived. A simple model is numerically analysed and the following novel phenomena are found out. The lattice vibration generates the light of frequency which added the integral multiple of the vibration frequency to that of the incident wave and also amplifies the incident wave resonantly. On a resonance, the amplification factor increases very rapidly with the number of layers increases. Resonance frequencies change with the phases of lattice vibration. The amplification phenomenon is analytically discussed for low frequency of the lattice vibration.},

Explicit expressions of nonleading contributions are obtained. The contribution of short distance is found to be in agreement with Standard Model predictions. It is presented as a general normalization factor. We check the validity of the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem about cancellation in the total width of the mass singularities at zero limit of electron mass.

This analysis gives the results $\rho=0.75014\pm 0.00017(\text{stat})\pm 0.00044(\text{syst})\pm 0.00011(\eta)$, where the last uncertainty arises from the correlation between $\rho$ and the decay parameter $\eta$, and $\delta = 0.75067\pm 0.00030(\text{stat})\pm 0.00067(\text{syst})$. These are consistent with the value of 3/4 given for both parameters in the Standard Model of particle physics, and are a factor of two more precise than the measurements previously published by TWIST. A new global analysis of all available muon decay data incorporating these results is presented. Improved lower and upper limits on the decay parameter $P_\mu^\pi\xi$ of $0.99524 < P_\mu^\pi\xi \leq \xi < 1.00091$ at 90% confidence are determined, where $P_\mu^\pi$ is the polarization of the muon when it is created during pion decay, and $\xi$ governs the muon decay asymmetry. These results set new model-independent constraints on the possible weak interactions of right-handed particles. Specific implications for left-right symmetric models are discussed.},

  abstract      = {We study the scaling regime of nucleon - anti-nucleon annihilation into a deeply virtual photon and a meson, bar p N -> gamma* pi. We obtain the leading twist amplitude in the kinematical region where it factorizes into an antiproton distribution amplitude, a short-distance matrix element related to nucleon form factor and the long-distance dominated transition distribution amplitudes which describe the nucleon to meson transition. We give the Q^2 evolution equation for these transition distribution amplitudes. The scaling of the cross section of this process may be tested at the proposed GSI intense anti-proton beam facility FAIR with the PANDA or PAX detectors. We comment on related processes such as pi N -> N' gamma* and gamma* N -> N' pi which may be experimentally studied at intense meson beams facilities and at JLab or Hermes, respectively.},

In the single-photon exchange approximation, GEp/GMp is directly proportional to Pt/Pl. The simultaneous measurement of Pt and Pl in a polarimeter reduces systematic uncertainties. The results for GEp/GMp show a systematic decrease with increasing Q2, indicating for the first time a definite difference in the distribution of charge and magnetization in the proton. The data have been reanalyzed and their systematic uncertainties have become significantly smaller than those reported previously.},

This system can measure the polarization of the electron beam to high statistical precision ($\sim 1.5\%$) in about 15 min, despite the $10^{-4}$ duty factor of the SLAC beam. The use of two arrays consisting of seven detectors each - with a total acceptance of $40^o$ in the center-of-mass frame -- reduced the sensitivity to many potential systematic errors. The large number of measurements, taken under a wide variety of experimental conditions, enabled a detailed search for the presence of systematic errors in the data.},

  abstract = {Section 1 .— The hypothesis that the electron has a magnetic moment was, as is well known, first introduced to account for the duplexity phenomena of atomic spectra. More recently, however, Dirac has succeeded in accounting for these same phenomena by the introduction of a modified wave equation, which conforms both to the principle of relativity and to the general transformation theory. Formally, at least, on the new theory also, the electron has a magnetic moment of εh/mc, but when the electron is in an atom we cannot observe this magnetic moment directly; we can only observe the foment of the whole atom, or, of course, the splitting of the spectral lines, which we may say is “caused” by this moment. The question arises, has the free electron "really” got a magnetic moment, a magnetic moment that we can by any conceivable experiment observe? The question is not so simple as it might seem, because a magnetic moment εh/mc can never be observed directly, e.g., with a magnetometer; there is always an uncertainty in the eternal electromagnetic field, due to the uncertainty in the position and velocity of the electron, and this uncertainty is greater than the effect of the electron magnet which we are trying to observe.},

  abstract = {1. In a previous paper the author has applied the relativistic theory of the electron due to Dirac to the problem of the scattering of electrons by atoms. The main purpose of the investigation was to discover whether any polarisation effect was to be expected when a beam of electrons was scattered by two successive targets. The experiment considered is illustrated in fig. 1. A beam of electrons LT1 is scattered by a target T1, and those that are scattered through a certain angle θ1, are allowed to fall on a second target T2. It was shown that the number of electrons scattered by this second target in any direction T2M making an angle θ2 with T1T2 depends on the angle Ф that the plane T1T2M makes with the plane LT1T2. Ф is taken to be zero when the electron follows the coplanar path LT1T2M. The number scattered along T2M is proportional to 1 + δ cos Φ, where δ is a positive constant depending on θ1, θ2. Thus more electrons are scattered along T2M than T2M' in the figure, the numbers being in the ratio 1 + δ :1 — δ. It should be noted that the theory deals with single nuclear scattering, and is therefore only applicable if the scattering targets are thin foils, sufficiently thin for multiple scattering to be negligible. In the paper quoted it was found that δ is extremely small unless the following conditions are satisfied.},
